One POC said their company is figuring out the feasibility of moving warehouses to other countries to avoid supply chain risk. One company told me their customers are calling them asking where their orders are–the packages are all being held in US ports until the customers ***pay the tariffs for the goods directly.*** Yes, you read that right. These companies are gonna lower revenue guidance by 30%+\n\nEven if Trump and Xi agree to lower tariffs substantially (which seems unlikely to me – Trump has been consistently talking about tariffs on China for decades), I'm not sure how much of the damage can be walked back. Once a company has a freak out about supply chains and tariffs they're going to take action to mitigate risks in case orange face does it again. And there's no chance in hell they're going to be hiring in this kind of risky environment.\n\nI think we're headed for years of negative real GDP growth. Besides unemployment from the retail sector, we're going to have million+ government works laid off by DOGE, and small to medium tech companies are going to lose contracts. (Who's gonna keep paying Hubspot or Monday a few hundred grand a year when GDP growth is negative)\n\nNot much looks investable in this environment. The only thing I like are gold miners (GDX, GDXJ). Even if gold takes a healthy haircut here, the miners are priced as if gold is at like $2000 an ounce, not $3000. These are basically companies that turn oil into gold, and in a deep recession, oil prices will also drop.\n\nGood luck to us all. We'll need it.",

        "body": "Everyone’s tripping out about why Tesla is ripping after awful earnings, so here’s what’s actually going on,  and what might happen tomorrow and the next few weeks. Tesla reported after hours. Margins are down, revenue is weak, guidance is fuzzy, and Elon pulled out the usual robotaxi speech, tariffs are bad, cheaper cars, robots making cars.... But instead of tanking, the stock jumped. Why?\n\nShort answer: markets don’t just trade the news,  they trade positioning and expectations.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nBefore earnings, implied volatility (IV) was high. That means options,  especially puts,  were expensive. Everyone was hedging or speculating on a big drop. If you bought puts, you and everyone else were betting Tesla would move more than the expected range.\n\nBut Tesla didn’t crash. It didn’t even dip. It went up.\n\nSo tomorrow morning, we will likely see IV crush when IV drops hard after earnings. That’s where Vega comes in. Vega measures how much an option’s price changes in relation to its implied volatility (IV). If you’re holding puts, and IV collapses, those options lose value quickly, even if Tesla trades in your direction or sideways.\n\nNow let’s talk about the feedback loop; this is where things get interesting. Market makers (dealers) are usually on the other side of all those puts. If they sell you a put, they’re taking on directional risk; if Tesla drops, they lose. So to protect themselves, they hedge.\n\nFor puts, that means shorting the stock to stay neutral. If the stock drops, their short hedge offsets their option losses.\n\nBut if the stock doesn’t drop,  or even worse, it goes up, they have to buy back their hedge to avoid getting wrecked. That buying pushes the stock price higher. And as the stock goes higher, they need to buy more to stay hedged. That’s a gamma feedback loop.\n\nAdd in short sellers covering their positions and a few retail traders chasing the pop, and suddenly you have a rally that feeds itself, even if the earnings were bad.\n\nBut it doesn’t mean the move is real or sustainable.\n\nThe big dogs (institutions) haven’t even acted yet. They’ll dissect the call overnight and into the next day. Some might sell the rip. Some might rebalance slowly over a few days. The real move sometimes doesn’t hit until later.\n\nLet’s be real,  this game isn’t just about puts and calls. Market makers, hedge funds, and institutional players have access to insane levels of data. They have entire teams of quants, analysts, PhDs, and machines that track options flow, gamma exposure, CBOE positioning, bond yields, Fed swaps, commodities, FX correlations; you name it. They don’t just trade the headlines; they trade the reaction to positioning around the headlines. They model the crowd’s behavior before the crowd even makes a move.\n\nIf this were as simple as “bad earnings = buy puts,” everyone would be rich. But it’s not. The options market is one of the deepest and most complex systems on the market. That’s why insider trading is illegal, and why billionaires get into politics,  to legally front-run the economy and gain access to real-time information that actually moves markets. That’s why your broker has analytics for gamma exposure, skew, delta hedging zones, not because it’s nice to have, but because it’s necessary if you want to survive in this ecosystem.\n\nYeah, some retail traders make big money, sometimes,  but that’s gambling. Without context, you’re flipping a coin. \n\nThis wasn’t about fundamentals. It was about positioning, hedging mechanics, and options flow.  \nThe market punished the crowded trade, as it always does.\n\nSo no, the system isn’t rigged. It’s just math, flow, and positioning. The market punishes the crowded trade. Too many people bet on a collapse, so the opposite happened.\n\nWelcome to the dealer’s game.",

Break even point is around 60 to 65 percent annualized load factor or occupancy rates for low cost, higher for middle to upper scale. Airlines flagship survive only because of national pride and government involvement . Also, These industries are good proxies to assess if we are in recession, the depth and if we are recovering. By all adjacent metrics ( skilled/quality mix, the one that pay high price, i.e business customers and meeting incentive conference exhibitions) and leisure customer ( low paying) we are already in recession. It will fully show in other hospitality companies, airlines and other industries in Q2 earnings. You may want to check the latest Management discussion and analysis of these companies ( and possible that they stay silent or conservative to avoid stock beating) we are going for a bumpy ride, tariffs or not tariffs unless the US customer can survive with The USA in isolation.

        "body": "When I first wrote about ASTS [4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0czbg/dd_asts_a_binary_bet_with_deep_space_value/), it was the first DD on the stock to appear on this subreddit. I told you to dismantle your grandparents porch to sell the top of lumber and buy the stock. I was kinda right but also terribly wrong as you can see in my [gain post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ewg3t9/conviction_or_mental_illness_you_decide_asts/). Now I am older, wiser, richer, and with a hotter wife and better DD. So settle in and learn something. Or don’t, it’s whatever. When you last ignored me there was one key point in the ASTS Investment Thesis:\n\n1) ASTS Wholesale Model gives them access to billions of customers and thereby revenue.\n\n* All Satellite companies (save for SpaceX’s Starlink) have failed because they cannot effectively monetize their service. Technology isn’t a problem, it’s the go-to-market strategy which fails. ASTS has solved this with its wholesale model working with existing telecoms under the FCCs rules for Supplemental Coverage from Space.\n\n* Iridium was one of the most incredible engineering accomplishments in history, everyone who used it loved it. It was the only way calls could be made in NYC on 9/11, the only way to call out of New Orleans in Hurricane Katrina, it’s the first thing every person at the top of Everest reaches for, the list goes on.\n\n* The problem is that Iridium couldn’t sell the service. It was expensive (for the specialized headset and by the minute in its use), people didn’t know it existed (Iridium were engineers not marketers), a market didn’t exist (maritime and remote villages and niche minute by minute sales does not a market make).\n\n   * ASTS solves this with its super wholesale model where AT&T, Verizon, Rakuten, Vodaphone, and others do all the marketing, all the sales, all the billing, and upsell their existing customer base for a service they want anyway (more on this later).\n\n      * ASTS does not need to find customers. Their agreements with the above give them instant access to 3B paying handsets overnight.\n\n      * ASTS does not need to sell the world a new device. Every cell phone just works.\n\nThat is the entire story that valued ASTS to its core investors since it started trading as a SPAC. While every single ASTS long term investor lost the love of their wives as the stock cratered to 1.98, the story changed. Five additional pillars have been layered on top of the above original thesis which makes me (and you if you are capable of reading) more bullish. They are as follows:\n\n2) Military Applications Non-Communications Use\n\n* The large array and patented technology have more uses than just communications with cell phones.\n\n   * They can be used as an alternative to GPS, for Missile Tracking, for PNT, and more.\n\n   * Any piece of military equipment that can accept a small wireless chip can use ASTS.\n\n   * The future of war is remote drone operations. They need connection. ASTS does that too.\n\n* ASTS was awarded (through a prime contractor) a United States Space Development Agency (SDA) contract worth $43 million\n\n   * This is for 6 satellites for one year and paid out linearly.\n\n   * Fairwinds advertisement for the service shows ASTS communicating with existing Military Satellites.\n\n   * This award will likely be expanded as more satellites come into service.\n\n* Hybrid Acquisition for proliferated Low-earth Orbit (HALO) program\n\n   * ASTS was awarded a starter contract as their own prime.\n\n   * The program can cover launch and parts costs on top of service payments.\n\n   * End game of this is ASTS use for missile tracking in the “Golden Dome” the Trump administration wants to build out.\n\n3) European Monopoly / Satco Joint Venture with Vodaphone\n\n* ASTS and Vodaphone created a joint venture for all of Europe where they will sell the service to other European Telcos. They will also be offering the service to the European Government much like the company is currently doing in the US.\n\n   * Importantly all the data will be sent and received entirely in the EU. All infrastructure will live in the EU. It will be an entirely European Company to be more marketable in Europe.\n\n* All of this has happened as Elon is nuking his rep in Europe with “roman” salutes and threating to withhold Ukraine’s access to Starlink. People are realizing that Elon is not dependable, and they need alternatives. ASTS is that alternative.\n\n4) The company has begun to acquire Ligado Spectrum to create their own data service which does not rely on the leasing of spectrum from AT&T and Verizon.\n\n* This Ligado spectrum has been unusable in the past due to interference with GPS and military spectrum in nearby bands.\n\n   * Ligado was using this Satellite Spectrum as Terrestrial with FCC waivers unsuccessfully.\n\n   * ASTS brings value to this spectrum through its beam forming which results in no interference.\n\n* Spectrum can be valued on a per mhz per population basis.\n\n   * At .40 - .80 /MHz-pop \\* 40 MHZ \\* 330M people in the United States we can value this spectrum at \\~8Billion dollars.\n\n      * This is the entire Market Cap of ASTS as it stands today.\n\n      * The company is acquiring the exclusive use of this spectrum for far below this cost. (350M + 4.7M penny warrants + 80M / year + small revenue share)\n\n      * The value of spectrum based on previous auctions likely discounts the future value of spectrum based on the number of connected devices we will be seeing in the future. There is more upside than the $8B figure represents (see point 5Bi).\n\n   * ASTS does its own design and manufacturing and is already designing a new satellite to work with its Ligado spectrum.\n\n   * This deal closing will allow ASTS to sell capacity to its partners or offer their own service ala Starlink.\n\n5) AI requires constant connectivity\n\n* [Facebook is spending $10B to put fiber underwater for bigger pipes for their own data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/29/meta-plans-to-build-a-10b-subsea-cable-spanning-the-world-sources-say/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB9Zn-QxaAgZypcTXZnX7qnT_XW8Gtm4Lo4e7AnQZD3d-HkWV24RLmg0B_RTon33a68Fc4NrzIVFSP-WXsOWjJOjFeE1wLz0KSRP2ZuVXG6ExThE5kmYcSVrb7JhUouBqIV1sWg4g1T-G7jWRobaSH1MIwaH3ANKhUl_xh4xsg7X). That’s all that you need to know about where the biggest companies believe data is going with the introduction of AI. ASTS solves this and blankets the entire earth with data connectivity (albeit with less speed).\n\n   * However, building this giant globe spanning fiber still does not solve the issue of connectivity in the outer reaches of the planet. This is just for the easily accessible areas meaning ASTS still provides value in data delivery which may be of use to companies like Facebook.\n\n* Autonomous AI Agents need connection and backup connections to operate. Data delivery in all corners of the world matters to make use of AI.\n\n* Think of every time you have paid $20 for internet on a plane. You need it access to data too, even if you think AI doesn’t (it does).\n\n   * Consider the number of connected “things” you have now. Airtags, smart watches, phones, laptops, cars, trucks, fucking killer drones from Palmer Lucky, farm equipment, doorbells, your wife’s WiFi Dildo that actually makes her cum unlike you, your WiFi buttplug, etc. All of this adds value to the ability to reliably deliver internet to all corners of the planet. That is ASTS’ market.\n\n6) Space is strategic\n\n* When I first wrote about the company I thought Elon and Bezos were just playing with the new billionaires toy of rockets. It turns out they were just one step ahead of the game. Space is strategic and having access to your own internet is incredibly valuable given the need for constant connection with AI. They know this and are leveraging their launch capacity to build out their own private internet.\n\n* ASTS benefits from an increase in launch capacity by having these billionaires fight for ASTS billions of dollars in launch costs. ASTS can essentially play king maker. Every dollar which goes to Blue Origin isn’t going to SpaceX and vice versa. ASTS future launch cadence with its \\~150 launches represents billions in launch costs. They can make the below fight for the lowest cost to get this future business.

Thanks. Starlink proper does not speak to cell phones which is why they require end users to have a dish or a mini dish to use their service. Their direct to cell solution with T-Mobile is not purpose built and has failed to deliver simple text messages. Take some time to read reviews of their service. It is complete shit and has no hopes of delivering broadband speed like ASTS without a complete redesign (which is probably difficult given that their lead engineer for D2C just left the company. Not a great look innit?). Alright with that out of the way we can continue. The rest of this writeup I completed for school and is a technical writeup of the company. Enjoy or whatever. There is very little information about the business valuation because I am not smart like that (or in any other way but neither are you). **If you want to know more**, read u/thekookreport ‘s DD [document](https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp). ***It is incredible and if you take the time to read it you might have the conviction required to acquire generational wealth. Good luck!*** Anyways here ya go bud:\n\n**Company and Industry Background**\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) is pioneering direct-to-device satellite connectivity, enabling standard, unmodified smartphones to connect directly to satellites for broadband cellular service. This groundbreaking technology positions ASTS uniquely to deliver global mobile broadband coverage, especially in areas lacking traditional terrestrial infrastructure. Through large, powerful phased-array antennas deployed on satellites in low Earth orbit, ASTS creates \"cell towers in space\" which provide seamless connectivity without the need for specialized satellite phones or additional equipment like satellite dishes.\n\nGlobally, approximately 2.6 billion people lack internet access (World Economic Forum), primarily due to economic barriers in deploying terrestrial networks in remote or sparsely populated regions. ASTS addresses this significant digital divide by allowing these individuals to access broadband services using any existing smartphone.\n\n*According to Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (“GSMA”), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 5.8 billion mobile subscribers are constantly moving in and out of coverage, approximately 3.4 billion people have no cellular broadband coverage and approximately 350.0 million people have no connectivity or mobile cellular coverage*.\n\nThere are approximately 6.8 Billion smartphones in the world all of which would be compatible with ASTS service on Day 1 without any modifications required as their service purely mimics existing GSMA service. As global connectivity becomes increasingly essential, particularly with the rapid expansion and integration of artificial intelligence, the value of ASTS grows exponentially.\n\nASTS strategically targets underserved regions in both developed and developing markets, focusing on areas where conventional terrestrial infrastructure is economically impractical or geographically challenging. The company's approach aligns with the FCC's Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) framework (FCC-23-22A1), which outlines the means of providing cell phone coverage from space and necessitates spectrum leasing agreements with established Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Recognizing this requirement, ASTS has secured strategic investments from industry leaders such as Google, AT&T, Verizon, American Tower, and Vodafone. These investments validate ASTS's technological and business approach, simultaneously offering traditional MNOs a beneficial partnership. Operators like AT&T and Verizon benefit by monetizing their spectrum in otherwise unused regions. This also benefits MNOs and American Tower by effectively hedging their terrestrial tower businesses against the propagation of space-based service and maximizing existing assets and valuable spectrum.\n\nUnlike conventional satellite phone providers or systems such as Starlink and Project Kuiper, which compensate for smaller satellite footprints by relying heavily on extensive ground infrastructure, ASTS's design is distinct. It employs significantly larger satellite antenna arrays, enabling direct communication with regular mobile phones without modifications. The large antennas generate a robust, \"loud\" signal from space, capable of directly reaching unmodified consumer devices—contrasting sharply with traditional satellite phones, which rely on devices actively searching for faint satellite signals. Additionally, ASTS's larger arrays dramatically reduce the total number of satellites needed for global coverage. For instance, while Project Kuiper plans to deploy 3,236 satellites and Starlink already operates over 8,000 satellites, ASTS aims to achieve global coverage with approximately 168 satellites. This not only optimizes efficiency but also addresses growing concerns about orbital congestion and space debris.\n\nThe wholesale go-to-market strategy adopted by ASTS leverages existing customer bases from mobile network operators, providing a significant competitive advantage. Unlike previous satellite endeavors, such as Iridium—which faced challenges not with technology but with market adoption due to high costs and complex marketing—ASTS offers a straightforward, accessible solution that integrates seamlessly with existing mobile ecosystems. The model ensures rapid adoption and scalability, delivering reliable broadband service globally without the barriers encountered by traditional satellite communication providers.\n\nTo further enhance customer accessibility and peace of mind, ASTS offers flexible pricing options such as day passes and affordable monthly fees, ensuring users remain consistently connected wherever they travel. This model caters to the growing expectation of constant connectivity, as increasingly more devices—including cars, smartwatches, location trackers, and other IoT gadgets—rely on continuous internet access. Consumers regularly demonstrate willingness to pay for reliable connectivity, just think of every time you have paid or considered paying $24.99 for in-flight Wi-Fi.\n\n*In fact, early findings show nearly two-thirds of subscribers are willing to pay extra \\[for satellite connectivity\\], with about half open to \\~$5/month for off-grid connectivity*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/686tx10740we1.png?width=805&format=png&auto=webp&s=76569830d31ca62109df32d826f844acd3d24de5\n\n**Source(s) of innovation**\n\nWhen a cell phone initiates a call or sends data, the signal travels through an uplink from the device to the nearest cell tower. At the tower’s base station, this signal is processed and forwarded through a high-capacity connection known as backhaul, typically via fiber-optic cables or microwave links, toward the network core. The network core functions like the network's brain, determining the signal’s destination and routing it accordingly. From the network core, the call or data is directed out through the appropriate aggregation points and backhaul connections toward the recipient’s nearest tower. At this final cell tower, the signal is sent via a downlink directly to the receiving user’s phone, completing the communication.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p4kc3cr740we1.png?width=493&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe5eb433f21ef132dd8abc60d8216506e65c150b\n\nIn contrast, ASTS' approach replaces traditional cell towers and terrestrial backhaul infrastructure with satellites positioned in low Earth orbit. When a phone communicates with AST's BlueBird satellite, the uplink signal travels directly from the user's phone to the satellite itself, acting as a \"tower in space.\" The satellite processes and beams the signal back down to strategically located ground gateways that connect to the terrestrial network core, bypassing the extensive network of ground towers and traditional backhaul. The core network then routes the call or data to the recipient, either via terrestrial towers or via another satellite beam. This approach effectively removes geographic barriers, delivering cellular connectivity even in remote or underserved areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is unavailable or economically impractical.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwbphlj840we1.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=d87b8e32dabc983d52690b9cc247a75357722035\n\nStarlink has recently gained significant attention with its high-profile Super Bowl advertisement showcasing their satellite texting offering with T-Mobile, bringing public awareness to direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity (Mobile World Live). However, despite this increased visibility, Starlink faces inherent technological limitations in its beam-forming capabilities. The satellite's antennas generate broad, flashlight-like beams that cover large geographical areas but lack precision. This approach leads to increased interference with neighboring networks and limits Starlink's ability to efficiently reuse spectrum, ultimately restricting network capacity and data throughput for individual users.\n\nStarlink's beam design contrasts sharply with more advanced D2D satellite systems that utilize precise, narrowly-focused beams to minimize interference and maximize spectrum efficiency. Due to Starlink's broader beam coverage, each satellite can serve fewer distinct user groups simultaneously, which reduces overall service quality and speed per user. As a result, while Starlink's high-profile marketing has drawn consumer attention to satellite-based mobile connectivity, its practical applications remain constrained, particularly in densely populated or interference-sensitive areas where efficient beam management and high throughput are critical.\n\nComparatively, ASTS employs significantly narrower, laser-focused beams enabled by their large phased-array antennas, as detailed in FCC filings (FCC 20200413-00034). ASTS satellites can generate beams as narrow as less than one degree, precisely targeting coverage areas and significantly reducing interference. In contrast, Starlink’s FCC filings (FCC 1091870146061) indicate beam widths that can span tens or hundreds of kilometers, with antenna gains around 38 dBi, resulting in broader coverage but increased interference and reduced spectral efficiency. ASTS's advanced beam-forming capabilities allow for precise, efficient frequency reuse and higher overall throughput per user, providing a notable advantage over Starlink in both performance and spectrum management.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xgl7egn940we1.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23b49ff581a6570c470fb5666a6006417d6fd50\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cfcf2mka40we1.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=cedc4388c33eef2189cebc720f5327cdf5091649\n\n\n\nThe top image taken from FCC Filings represents the antenna pattern for ASTS' system, akin to a laser pointer, with a very sharp, narrow central beam and significantly lower sidelobes. This tight focus ensures the energy is highly concentrated, minimizing interference with other areas and maximizing the signal strength in the intended coverage zone. Conversely, the bottom image illustrates Starlink's broader beam pattern, similar to a flashlight, with a wide central lobe and substantial sidelobes. The broader distribution of energy leads to greater interference and less precise coverage, reducing overall network efficiency and limiting the achievable throughput per user.\n\nASTS innovation is best shown in their extensive patent portfolio some of which protect this signal creation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fzqf4ijb40we1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=2112a61c00314bf51eb1de3a0837501f7067bc96\n\nASTS utilizes significantly larger satellites featuring advanced phased-array antennas that unfold in orbit, allowing them to generate stronger and more precise signals directly to standard mobile phones. The satellite itself employs a straightforward \"bent pipe\" design, which simply receives signals from phones and redirects them toward ground gateways without complex onboard processing. The sophisticated management of signals is handled by ASTS's proprietary software on the ground, ensuring seamless integration with existing mobile carrier networks and compatibility with current and future mobile technologies (including 6G). We can examine some key patents  from the company to gain a better understanding of their technology advantage:\n\n**Mechanical Deployable Structure for LEO:** This patent covers AST’s deployment mechanism for its large flat satellites​. The satellite’s antenna array is made of many square/rectangular panels (with solar on one side and antennas on the other) hinged together with spring-loaded connectors. These stored-energy hinges (often called spring tapes) automatically unfold the panels into a contiguous flat array once the satellite is in space, without needing motors or power to do the deployment. In essence, the satellite launches compactly folded up, and when it reaches orbit, it pops open on its own like a spring-loaded blanket. This is a core enabler for ASTS business: it allows them to fit a very large antenna into a small launch volume and reliably deploy it in orbit​. The self-deploying design reduces complexity and points of failure (since fewer motors or controls are needed), lowering launch and manufacturing costs. Successfully deploying a massive antenna is critical for AST’s service capability.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7iewd2jc40we1.png?width=823&format=png&auto=webp&s=6561e0f1bf475df91dddb0b405ce48f860b72ad4\n\n**Integrated Antenna Module with Thermal Management:** This patent describes the flat antenna module that integrates solar cells and radio antennas into one structure and includes built-in cooling features​. In simple terms, each panel on ASTS satellite serves as both a power source (via solar cells) and a communication antenna, while also dissipating its own heat. This means the satellite can be made up of many such panels tiled into the huge antenna array above without overheating. This innovation allows ASTS to deploy very large, power-efficient antennas in orbit, enabling stronger signals and broad coverage for mobile users without the weight or complexity of separate cooling systems.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/igtsmgfd40we1.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=46f9469918898ad963dcaab50aa229f2ce8ffdc1\n\n**Dynamic Time Division Duplex (DTDD) for Satellite Networks:** This patent introduces a smart timing controller that manages uplink and downlink signals so they don’t collide when using time-division duplex (TDD) over satellite​. In layman’s terms, because satellites are far away, signals take longer to travel – this system dynamically adjusts when a phone should send vs. receive so that echoes of a transmission don’t interfere with new data. For ASTS, this technology is crucial: it lets standard mobile phones communicate seamlessly with satellites by fine-tuning timing, which improves network reliability and throughput. Without this patent the time between uplink and downlink would result in loss of signal as normal cell signals are not used to the latency experienced in space travel.\n\n**Geolocation of Devices Using Spaceborne Phased Arrays:** This patent outlines a method for pinpointing a phone’s location from space using the satellite’s phased-array antenna​. The satellite first uses its multiple beams to get a rough location (which cell or area the device is in), then refines the device’s position by analyzing Doppler shifts and signal travel time. The satellite can not only talk to your phone but also figure out where you are by how your signal frequency changes (due to motion) and delays, similar to how GPS works but using the communication signal itself.\n\n**Direct GSM Communication via Satellite:** This patent covers a solution that allows standard GSM mobile phones (2G phones) to connect directly to a satellite​. The system involves a satellite with a coverage area divided into cells and a ground infrastructure that includes a feeder link and tracking antenna to manage the connection. A primary processing device communicates with the active users’ phones, and a secondary processor adjusts timing delays for all the beams/cells. This tricks the GSM phones into thinking the satellite is just another cell tower by handling the long signal delay.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8er6l9e40we1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&s=abca83f58c82d29a8223d56ad0a26db503aecf2e\n\n**Network Access Management for Satellite RAN:** This patent describes a method to efficiently handle when a user device first tries to connect to a satellite-based radio network​. The idea is to use a single wide beam from the satellite to watch for any phone requesting access across a large area of many cells. Once a phone’s request is detected in a particular cell, the system then lights up that cell with a focused beam (and can broadcast necessary signals to other inactive cells as needed). Essentially, the satellite first yells “anyone out there?” over a broad area, and when a phone waves back, the satellite switches to a more targeted conversation with that phone’s sector. This on-demand beam switching is business-critical for ASTS: it conserves power and spectrum by not constantly servicing empty regions, allowing one satellite to cover many cells efficiently. It means the network can support more users over a wide area with fewer satellites, lowering operational costs and improving user experience by quickly granting access when someone pops up in a normally quiet zone.\n\n**Satellite MIMO Communication System:** This patent describes a technique for using multiple antennas on both the satellite (or satellites) and the user side to create a MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) link for data​. In simple terms, the base station on the ground can send out multiple distinct radio streams through different satellite beams or even different satellites to a device that has several antennas. By doing so, the end user (if capable, like modern phones with multiple antennas) can receive parallel data streams, boosting throughput.\n\n**Seamless Beam Handover Between Satellites:** This patent deals with handing off a user’s connection from one low-Earth-orbit satellite to the next to avoid dropped calls or data sessions​. It outlines a system where an area on Earth (cell) that is covered by a setting satellite (one moving out of view) is also in view of a rising satellite. The network uses overlapping beams: one satellite’s beam and then the other’s beam cover the same cell during handover. A processing device orchestrates two communication links and switches the user’s session from the first satellite to the second as the first goes over the horizon.\n\n**Types/Patterns of Innovation**\n\n**Initial Testing**\n\nAST began its journey in 2019 with modest yet creative experiment. Their first satellite, BlueWalker 1 (BW1), placed the components of an everyday cell phone into space as a nanosatellite developed in collaboration with NanoAvionics. Instead of the conventional and costly approach—launching a satellite to communicate with ground-based phones, AST reversed this arrangement. They connected a cell phone in orbit with a specialized ground-based satellite (BlueWalker 2). This unusual yet insightful solution significantly reduced the initial costs of launch deployment, enabling rapid and cost-effective R&D. This approach was innovative both economically and operationally, demonstrating practical, real-world viability of their core concept.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkwipmdf40we1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5c9f53577d14b69f873d75c4a3e98bfd039c361\n\n**Funding and Expansion**\n\nEarly on, the company attracted strategic backing from the telecom industry. In 2020, a Series B round of $110 million was led by Vodafone and Japan’s Rakuten, with participation from Samsung, and American Tower signaling broad industry confidence in AST’s direct-to-phone satellite technology. Importantly, during this time these investors did their own due diligence on the business and verified the work up to this point and the business case. Rather than a traditional IPO, ASTS utilized a SPAC merger to go public: in April 2021 it merged with New Providence Acquisition Corp., raising a total of $462 million in gross proceeds including $230 million from a PIPE investment by Vodafone, Rakuten, and American Tower.\n\n**BlueWalker 3 Satellite**\n\nWith SPAC funding secured, ASTS increased their R&D spend to launch a fully functional satellite, BlueWalker 3 (BW3), featuring the largest phased-array antenna ever deployed in space (save for the international space station). The satellite was approximately 700 sq ft, roughly the size of a one-bedroom apartment. BW3 employed Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), enabling in-orbit software upgrades and flexible testing to allow changes not captured with BW1 to be complete after launch. Successful demonstrations of BW3's capability included groundbreaking tests such as the first-ever 5G video call from space to an everyday smartphone in Hawaii, validating their ability to deliver advanced broadband connectivity directly from orbit.\n\n**BlueBird Block 1**\n\nIn September 2024, AST took critical steps toward commercialization with the launch of their first commercial satellites BlueBirds 1 through 5 (Space.com). These satellites further tested vital functionalities, including seamless handoffs between satellites, a key requirement for global continuous connectivity. These launches were strategically significant, marking the transition from proof-of-concept to scalable commercial operations. Demonstration video calls were conducted and announced through MNO partners Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon for testing AST’s technology in real-world networks. These tests were the result of the FCC granting a Special Temporary Authority (STA) to the company. This was particularly significant given its alignment with the broader regulatory landscape under the new FCC commissioner Brendan Carr (Trump Appointed) which shows the regulatory and market acceptance of AST's innovative business model. Further, this removed the Elon Musk sized elephant in the room wherein Starlink was thought to be the only satellite gaining the approval under the new administration.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eug6ardg40we1.png?width=655&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ae60b0b69faf8b96915df1273f762cef6232861\n\n**Next-Generation ASICs**\n\nAST is also innovating on hardware performance through development of next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Replacing initial FPGA implementations, these ASIC chips promise a 100x increase in data throughput (as in total data deliverable). This dramatic efficiency improvement increases future satellite capabilities and economic performance, making their network even more attractive for commercial deployment.\n\n**Next-Generation Satellites**\n\nAST’s innovation continues with BlueBird 2 (BB2), a significantly scaled-up satellite design of 2,400 sq ft. Incorporating next-gen ASIC technology, these satellites represent a major leap forward in performance and capability, scheduled to be launched through agreements with Blue Origin, ISRO, and SpaceX. Through increased size and performance from the ASIC, ASTS intends to increase the 30mbps download speed represented by Block 1 to 120 mbps in future iterations of their technology. By the end of 2026, AST aims to have a constellation of approximately 60 satellites in orbit, bolstered by substantial financial backing with over $1 billion in available capital.\n\n**Strategic Spectrum Acquisition**\n\nSee above Ligado. At character limit.\n\n**Military and Government Partnerships**\n\nRecognizing strategic opportunities, AST has advanced their military use cases, positioning its technology as a solution for the U.S. Department of Defense and Space Development Agency (SDA). With their satellite constellation able to integrate seamlessly with existing military satellite communication (MILSATCOM) infrastructure AST becomes highly relevant for sensitive government applications such as missile tracking, asset monitoring, and secure communications. A recent $43 million SDA contract further highlights AST’s alignment with national security interests and confirms their technology’s strategic importance.\n\n*As part of the U.S. Space Force, SDA will accelerate delivery of needed space-based capabilities to the joint warfighter to support terrestrial missions through development, fielding, and operation of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo72i4ih40we1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcb2d233638254aaa7e9b114c9ffb64251c1bb0\n\n**Definition of “Value-added” for the Firm’s Products/Services**\n\n**Resilience in Disaster Response**\n\nOne of the most compelling advantages of a space-based cellular network is its resilience during disasters. When hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or other natural disasters strike, terrestrial infrastructure often fails. Cell towers can be knocked out by storms or burned in wildfires, leaving first responders and affected communities without communication exactly when it’s most needed. ASTS satellite technology adds a crucial layer of redundancy: even if ground towers are down, the network in the sky and a single base station anywhere in the country remains operational. This capability can be life-saving in emergency scenarios.\n\nASTS has been working closely with AT&T to integrate its system with FirstNet, the dedicated U.S. public safety network for first responders. FirstNet, built by AT&T, provides priority cellular service to police, firefighters, EMTs and other emergency personnel. By extending FirstNet into space, ASTS ensures that first responders stay connected in real time, anywhere. The value added by ASTS in disaster response is clear: persistent coverage when conventional networks fail.\n\n**Cost Efficiency Compared to Subsea Cables**\n\nBuilding out global internet connectivity has traditionally meant expensive infrastructure projects, such as undersea fiber-optic cables to connect continents. These projects involve enormous capital expenditures and long deployment timelines. ASTS' approach – launching a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites – presents a potentially more flexible and cost-efficient path to worldwide broadband coverage. A rough cost comparison highlights this difference in strategy and scalability. ASTS plans to deploy a complete constellation of 168 satellites to achieve global coverage. Each satellite in AST’s “BlueBird” series is estimated to cost on the order of $20 million to build and launch.\n\n*Brian Graft, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Anything on the cost per satellite? Has that changed at all? Are you still in that $19,000,000 to $21,000,000 range? Abel Avellan: No. Yes, we’re not changing the guidance on cost per satellite*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ekodb1pi40we1.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=03caa476262231e043b928ceacdee51a854d05d0\n\nIt’s important to note that satellite broadband isn’t a wholesale replacement for fiber in terms of raw capacity – major cables can carry tremendous data volume at very low latency along their fixed routes, which is vital for the core internet backbone. However, from a business strategy perspective, ASTS' satellites offer a more economical way to extend the “last mile” of connectivity to users who would otherwise require huge investment to reach.\n\n**Enabling Always-On Connectivity for Emerging Technologies**\n\nBeyond simply connecting people, ASTS' continuous global coverage unlocks critical opportunities for emerging technologies that depend on uninterrupted internet access. For AI agents and cloud services, constant connectivity is essential. Autonomous robotics, including self-driving cars, drones, and agricultural robots, similarly benefit from AST’s satellite service, ensuring seamless operation even in remote areas beyond traditional cellular coverage.\n\n**Strategic Independence and the European D2D Initiative**\n\nSee Above SatCo JV with Vodaphone. Need to cut word count.\n\n**Wholesale Model**\n\nNomadBets twitter shows the breakdown of subscriber potential with ASTS. This is where revenue will blow out all expectations. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lr5z0xo40we1.png?width=1586&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c48c2596ef8e077b391cf1ac8121122604a86d8\n\nASTS competencies are built around its ability to design, manufacture, and deploy large and powerful satellites optimized for direct-to-device (D2D) connectivity. All of which are critical for maximizing signal strength, bandwidth, and data throughput directly to everyday smartphones. AST's expertise in large arrays is particularly advantageous, as bigger (and thereby heavier) arrays translate directly into stronger signals, increased power generation, and significantly improved data speeds to user devices. ASTS requires just 168 large satellites for global coverage, compared to 3,236 for Amazon's Kuiper and over 8,158 for SpaceX's Starlink, this greatly reduces CAPEX, collision risk, launch risk, and replacement costs for AST. With all this in mind, AST benefits greatly from falling launch costs enabled by leading space-launch providers such as Blue Origin and SpaceX. This is best displayed as a year-over-year pricing trend of launch vehicles on a per-kilogram basis:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4czj2u8q40we1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b1dc9937bf0e7f1da432fb69857d50618053670\n\nAs launch providers increasingly offer higher-capacity rockets at reduced costs, ASTS uniquely benefits from its strategy of deploying fewer, heavier satellites with large, high-performance antennas rather than numerous smaller satellites. The first successful flight of Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket notably demonstrated its capability to carry up to eight of AST’s Block 2 satellites simultaneously, providing a clear cost advantage. Likewise, SpaceX’s Falcon 9, recognized globally for its reliability and affordability, can accommodate four Block 2 satellites per launch. Additionally, the progress on SpaceX’s Starship program offers further promise, potentially unlocking even greater launch capacities at lower costs.\n\nAST's operational competencies are further strengthened by its vertical integration.\n\n*Approximately 95% vertically integrated for manufacturing of satellite components and subsystems, for which we own or license the IP and control the manufacturing process*.\n\nBy controlling its own production processes and intellectual property, AST not only reduces dependency on external suppliers—mitigating geopolitical and supply-chain risks—but also achieves superior cost efficiencies and quality control. This vertical integration is crucial at a time when the United States is prioritizing domestic capability in strategic industries like space technology, positioning AST favorably to benefit from increasing governmental support and protective policies.\n\nThe company's production strategy is robust and ambitious, with AST targeting a monthly production rate of six satellites at its Texas factory. This consistent cadence enables rapid scaling and timely replacement of satellites, ensuring continuous, reliable service for customers. Given rising geopolitical tensions, particularly concerning competition with China in space exploration and technology, AST's fully integrated, U.S.-based manufacturing operation places it strategically to capitalize on potential government partnerships or contracts aimed at strengthening domestic space capabilities.\n\n**Organizational Structure/Culture/Leadership**\n\nThis section was about the leadership team of the company. It is just regurgitated from their own website and is not really valuable. Here is all you need to know: the CEO Abel Avellan is a certified bad ass. He has had a successful exit from his first company EMC and used that cash to fund this company. He takes no salary, he doesn’t have a crazy stock based compensation that he extracts with, he is just a good dude who is aligned with the company and its investors. He doesn’t spend his day on twitter trying to impregnate Tiffany Fong. He has not lied about his ability to play Diablo or PoE2. We like Abel. You should too.\n\nPositions Disclosure:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra1e5a8v40we1.png?width=1435&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f600912d596eb2619a4a666c7b4b8b2ecfdf22f\n\n",

Also, Obviously, if a deal is agreed upon, the tariffs would be nowhere near 145% - Trump did not say he is lowering China tariffs effective immediately. \n\nAnd of course Trump would say he has no intention of firing Powell to the press. Thus far, Powell has not done anything that would be viewed as not performing his duty, in which case the president would be able to terminate him. \n\nAll the news that came out today is just the media twisting the headlines/clickbaits. People need to read beyond just the title of news articles.",

I agree everything says we’re going down for 1-6 months and we’re going to be seeing the negative economic outlook for a very long time.

        "body": "\nComplement to a former post. \nAny jump in airlines stock price is just dancing around for now\n\nThe Travel crisis that is emerging will affect other industries that profit from tourism, like real estate and Banks\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/very-rapid-drop-domestic-demand-182820043.html\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/7nEvEsNjpp\n\nhttps://sherwood.news/business/us-airlines-in-a-recession-southwest-ceo/\n\nOn the international front, for majors Airlines, Chinese and other Asian international tourists are crucial to their long-haul operations. Shanghai Pudong round trip to Dallas-Fort Worth is a common route that is seing drastic decrease for AAL.\n\nA downturn in both leisure and business tourism leads to reduced hotel occupancy rates, lower room pricing, and decreased revenue, particularly in tourist-centric cities like Las Vegas, Orlando, and New York City.\n\nCompanies/stock potentially affected: Host Hotels & Resorts Inc., Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. \n\nTenet Healthcare (THC) – Dallas, TX maybe affcted too. They owns hospitals and medical centers, some of which attract foreign patients for medical tourism.\n\nCarnival Corporation (CCL) – Miami, FL, world’s largest cruise line, heavily dependent on international tourists, including Chinese travelers.\n\nRoyal Caribbean Group (RCL) – Miami, FL, same as Carnival, with an even more aggressive focus on Asia-Pacific expansion, including China-based cruise itineraries.\n\nMany Buffalo/NY small businesses rely on Canadian spending. If revenue drop, they cant pay rent, if they cant pay rent, landlords cant service mortage debt. More businesses will close like in covid or after covid.\n\nLennar Corporation (LEN) – Miami, FL, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S has lot of Chinese buyers: Florida (and Texas) have been targets for foreign real estate investment, particularly by Chinese nationals seeking EB-5 visas or U.S. property. So real estate may be affected too, in this case, may be it will relieve pressure on prices, not sure. But for REITS (real estate investment trusts) that owns properties leased to Hotels and restaurants or Malls or international student housing that depends on international travellers or Transit/transcient business, trouble are ahead in all major US Cities. \n\nEvent Spaces & Convention Centers: A reduction in MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) activities weakens demand for event spaces and the surrounding businesses that support them. ALL major hotels brand affected.\n\nDiversified REITs: These entities, with portfolios spanning retail, hotel, and mixed-use developments in major gateway cities, face indirect impacts from the downturn in tourism and international student presence: Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), BXP, Inc. (BXP)\n\nThe third financed asset in size for all major banks after government bonds and other bank is real estate ( commercial and residential)\n\nalso, if all foreign countries keep rejecting boeing planes delivery like china, it is the whole aerospace sector that is going down with all of the small industries and SMEs that their business model feeds. \n\nhttps://fortune.com/article/boeing-ceo-trump-china-tariff-trade-war-planes-economy/\n\nWell no wonder T is saying now: we are discussing with China, but they said: heuuu, no we are not discussing yet. remove all tariffs first, holder of negotiation power is obvious. So until all of this is fixed and factoring at least few months of starring, the crash is coming.\n\nAnd we have not even talked about the soccer world cup being potentially cancelled in a year by the US, by FiFa or by implicit boycott by countries outside of Usa because not safe and impact on existing contracts with airlines, hotels and hosting cities that have spent millions\n\n\nAll of this might sound exaggerated, but at this point, given what we have been seeing and hearing lately, anything is possible.\n\nI won’t hold a high position when shorting airlines, since they are highly volatile and already close to 52 weeks low. but I will average up a short position. Should back test Covid trading range volatility to see how low it can get",

He also said that the strongest relationship between Washington and Beijing is at the top, and that there was no timeframe for engagement. He said that a full rebalancing of trade might take two to three years.\n\nTrump said separately on Wednesday that the US is going to have a fair deal with China.\n\nThe Treasury chief also said that the US and India are “very close” on a trade agreement. He reiterated that a satisfactory arrangement doesn’t mean an actual trade document — signaling, as he has before, that initial deals with trading partners will be a broad framework rather than a detailed trade agreement.",

However, I recognize that even in a bear market there can be face ripping rallies that last for weeks, sometimes months.  Set your levels and risk tolerance.  I don't see any situation in the next 2 years where we breach ATH again (does anyone believe our current situation will be better than where we were in January 2025?).  That is the ceiling.  However, the downside risks are enormous, hence why my largest positions are bear ETFs.\n\nYeah, I know this is a casino full of degenerates, but you should still understand the risks of buying short dated calls and puts in this environment.  Selling options capitalizes on the high IV and puts theta on your side.  Set reasonable stop losses and close out profits early.",

If those give way, we’re looking at a death cross, oversold RSI, and zero sentiment support = panic sell mode.\n\t•\tNo earnings guidance. No new products. Global pullbacks.

They inverse retail, go long, and cause a feedback loop where dumb money goes short, and smart money longs. \n\nBut soft data lags hard data. Eventually, big money will \\*have\\* to sell their holdings because \n\n1) dividend payouts shrink\n\n2) stock buybacks deplete, and companies instead dilute shares to make up for loss of earnings growth\n\n3) cash reserves deplete as companies instead take on losses\n\nbut this takes time to play out. You can't time it.\n\nThats why the better play, instead of shorting, is to either go long, hold cash, or go into an alternative investment.\n\nPersonally I am very long gold. The fed is going to crank up the money printer to offset recession fears and signal that bond yields are A-OK (they shit their pants when the 30 year neared 5%). The dollar is going down a bad road atm and I think gold will eventually hit a mania phase that will massively outpace equity growth, even given the \"wall of worry\" (if you look at real returns over the next five years).\n\nIf you are trading day to day, none of this matters. But long term I think that gold and cash are the only play.",

Out with Pat Gelsinger and in with a new CEO, Lip Bu Tan, who knows how to make money (previously with a VC firm as well as with Cadence Designs). \n\nLBT has already started trimming the fat and I expect we see Intel over $100B market cap sooner rather than later. Current administration’s desire to bring home manufacturing can only help that case. \n\nPeople say stuff like “their book value is $21.xx per share” or their current products suck, their new fabs are going to rival TSMC, among other positive or negative things..

        "body": "The bull case for Target is dead. I’m loading up on puts like it’s 2008 and this place sells CDOs. Here’s why:\n\nTL;DR:\nConsumer spending is falling. Foot traffic is down. Earnings are flat. They're getting wrecked by Walmart, Amazon, and Costco. Their DEI pivot backfired and pissed everyone off. Tariffs are incoming. Margins are about to get smoked. I'm buying puts, and it’s looking real good.\n\nFinancials are soft:\n\nQ4 2024 revenue: $30.92B (beat, but barely)\n\nFull-year 2024 net sales: $106.6B, down from $107.4B in 2023\n\nFull-year EPS: $8.86, down from $8.94\n\nStock is already down 20% over the past year\n\nYou can’t spin that into a growth story. Flat is the new down, especially with macro pressure.\n\nPeople aren’t shopping there anymore:\n\n10 straight weeks of declining in-store foot traffic\n\nCutting back DEI stuff alienated both sides of the aisle\n\nCostco is scooping up their customers and their lunch\n\nCurbside and online aren’t saving them like they used to\n\nTariffs + Recession = Profit Implosion:\n\nTrump’s new tariffs are hammering imports from China, Mexico, and Canada\n\nTarget has to either eat the cost or pass it to consumers. Both suck.\n\nTheir CFO straight-up said consumer spending is cautious and soft\n\nGDP forecast for Q1 2025 is negative. Recession vibes confirmed.\n\nThey’re getting crushed from all sides:\n\nWalmart is cheaper and better positioned\n\nAmazon dominates online\n\nCostco is recession-proof and more beloved\n\nTarget is stuck in the middle, with no clear value prop\n\nThe trade:\n\nBuying more Jan 2026 $70P and $65P\n\nIV still reasonable for now\n\nTariffs + weak macro + earnings misses = real downside\n\nIf this cracks below $90 again, it could fall off a cliff.\n\nFinal thought:\n\nThis isn’t just a bearish play. This is a breakdown in identity. Target’s stuck trying to please everyone and is failing to please anyone. Consumers are broke, boycotting, and buying bulk from Costco. Their pricing isn't competitive. Their foot traffic is drying up. Their margins are at risk. And their best-case scenario is flat sales. Not exactly a growth story.\n\nShort $TGT. Buy puts. Let the charts do the talking.\n\n*EDIT* Positions added below\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yyeWZyy",

There's currently, basically no other suppliers of it.   The last US mine for it, was in California and closed in the mid '90s.  It's possible that new sources could be found and at an elevated price level could be worth mining.   But it's likely to take years to come on stream.  In the meantime Rolls Royce, GE, P&W and Safran (make CFM jet engines with GE) could be totally screwed for both the civil and military markets.  Which would screw Boeing and Airbus.

The problem with Boeing is, they relied so heavily on being irreplacable, that their planes literally fell out of the air. This is what a monopoly does to a company (And many us automakers will experience that soon as well.) The chinese clearly intend to force their own aircraft into the market and Boeing (well and \"someone\") just opened the gates and let the trojan horse in.

Those assets are down about 15% since then. \n4) lots of money spent repairing all the damage from all the arson and vandalism experienced. While they have insurance, this increases their premiums and they still have deductibles. \n5) collapsing margins. They had to radically reduce the price of all their cars especially their cyber truck just to get them to move. This is all coming from their top line. On top of that they're going to make a warning about additional cost related to tariffs which will impact their yields moving forward. \n6) the market in China is going to completely dry up. Byd already took most of that market share and the tariffs kill the rest of it. They won't move more than a handful of cars moving forward \n\nI'm sure he'll try to goose the market with more promises about full self-driving and robotaxis, but everyone knows those are empty promises now.\n\nThe problem is when it's this obvious that it's going to be such a huge miss, you have a lot of people shorting it leading up to it. Those people all are looking to buy back right after earnings which creates a spike in the market ironically enough. It's essentially \"sell the news\" but inverted.",

        "created_utc": "2025-04-21T16:47:51+00:00",
        "body": "Hi all,\n\nA couple of weeks back, I[ posted a \\[DD\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jqfz91/dd_how_to_profit_off_the_trade_war_500k_invested/?rdt=52089) where I explained my trading strategy as tensions over trade between the United States and China continued to increase. We are now at an inflection point and I expect that several events over the next few weeks will send stocks in my preferred sector soaring. In this post, I’ll explain what these events are and I will provide an update on my portfolio as far as this sector is concerned.\n\nMy thesis, again, remains the same as it always was:\n\n>**Thesis:** the mining industry presents a massive opportunity anywhere from right now to the end of the present US administration and hopefully beyond. The investments that will matter most have to do with the processing, extraction, separation, and manufacturing of titanium, lithium, and rare earth minerals deemed critical. These investments must be allied with western interests, ideally operating in the United States. The issue that is most relevant is the complete market dominance China has over these metals and rare earth minerals. \n\n**1. MP Materials Ceases Shipments to China (and why this is great news)**\n\nThe only vertically integrated operational rare earth mining and processing company in the United States is MP Materials. In previous posts, I canvassed a number of reasons to be bullish about this company, beyond the fact that they have the domestic side of the market locked down. These reasons included substantial stakes taken recently by institutional investors, as well as a number of executive actions and legislation.\n\nThis past Thursday, MP materials released a press statement noting that they have[ ceased shipments to China](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-accelerates-strategy-to-reindustrialize-the-rare-earth-supply-chain/). This is significant, given their previous export history with China (and relatedly, their dependence on Chinese processing to refine their materials). They write:\n\n>In response to China’s retaliatory tariffs and export controls, MP Materials (NYSE: MP) has ceased shipments of rare earth concentrate to China. Selling our valuable critical materials under 125% tariffs is neither commercially rational nor aligned with America’s national interest.\n\n>We have been preparing for this moment since day one. Our mission, capital strategy, and execution reflect a long-term vision built to withstand short-term dislocation and emerge stronger.\n\nI believe (in agreement) that any downward pressure on MP will be short-lived, although I am sure it will be volatile this week (today, very much so). The strategic timing of this press release, however, signals to me that they have already secured assurances from the present administration that they will support the company through purchasing agreements similar to those that will come from the planned executive order on[ stockpiling deep sea minerals. ](https://www.mining.com/trump-planning-to-stockpile-deep-sea-minerals-to-counter-china-ft/)\n\nMoreover, ceasing shipments to China signals that MP materials has a margin of comfort with their capacity and ability to refine their own materials, such that they no longer feel bound to depend on China to process any of their materials whatsoever. Indeed, they write:\n\nMP has invested nearly $1 billion to restore the full rare earth supply chain in the United States. Today, our California refinery is processing nearly half of our production, with virtually all of that material sold into markets outside China—including Japan, South Korea, and the United States.\n\n**II. Critical Minerals Import Controls**\n\nAs if the above were not enough, the present administration recently issued an order to investigate critical minerals import controls[ *a la* Section 232](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-ensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-critical-minerals-and-derivative-products/). The factsheet notes:\n\n>\\[This\\] Order directs the Secretary of Commerce to initiate a Section 232 investigation under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to evaluate the impact of imports of these materials on America’s security and resilience. This investigation will assess vulnerabilities in supply chains, the economic impact of foreign market distortions, and potential trade remedies to ensure a secure and sustainable domestic supply of these essential materials.The investigation will culminate in a report detailing risks and providing recommendations to strengthen domestic production, reduce dependence on foreign suppliers, and enhance economic and national security. \n\nFollowing this report, the administration may well decide to impose tariffs on critical minerals, taking the place of any current reciprocal tariffs pursuant to the April 2 order tariff.\n\nI recommend that each of you interested in this sector read the fact sheet in its entirety. It does a fantastic job explaining just how critical this investigation is and provides an overview of the issues plaguing the domestic side of the industry, including price manipulation by China.\n\n**III. Ukraine Minerals Deal**\n\nAs if the two points above were not enough, the present administration also signaled today that Ukraine plans to negotiate and sign a minerals deal within the next few weeks. They’ve already signed an[ agreement by way of a memorandum.](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/17/nx-s1-5366821/trump-italy-meloni) \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicts that the deal would be signed around April 26. \n\n>It's substantially what we agreed on previously when the president was here,\" Bessant said. \"We had a memorandum of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and an 80-page agreement and that's what we'll be signing.\"\n\nThe question of what this agreement will look like in its final form is unknown. However, I would not be surprised if the raw materials obtained in Ukraine would be shipped to the USA for refining. If that were so, MP materials would stand to benefit tremendously. \n\n**IV. Portfolio Update**\n\nBefore signing off, I wanted to also provide an update on the holdings in my portfolio:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rs9b47rcw7we1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e8f423ee5d7ce51bc989883bfe79dac7486fd28\n\nI hold a mixture of calls and shares in these positions. A number have already begun to return sizable gains. See, for example, recent profits from[ MP here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1jz8w2l/the_mines_were_calling_400k_profit_day/).\n\nEnjoy the opening bell, everyone!",

Let's say Russia is pushed \"out\", and we go back to 2022 borders.\n\nLet's state some facts.\n\n- Building up the infrastructure to do any mining whatsoever is a years long process in the modern day.  Doesn't matter where you're mining.\n\n- Russia has a habit of just stealing the assets of western countries and absorbing them into the state / selling them to oligarchs\n\n- China and its bloc (of which Russia is now a subservient part) have a vested interest in maintaining their current  hold over these minerals.\n\n- Russia is known for industrial sabotage and attempting the assassination of foreign nationals and business leaders.\n\n- Ukraine, Russia, and Iran are now all (relative) leaders in the drone space.  There are many countries that are capable of developing drones, and it's not necessarily easy to know who owns which drone.\n\n- Many of the known rare earth deposits Ukraine would extract are right along the border with Russia, or otherwise within missile and drone distance.\n\nSo, if you're a company that wants to extract these minerals, you need:\n\n- A peace deal that is worth the paper it's printed on\n\n- A guarantee Russia isn't going to just invade (ie - nuclear-backed countries paying people to stand around and act as a canary in the coal mine)\n\n- A guarantee that a revanchist Ukraine won't try to get back at Russia after Zelenskyy is out\n\n- A guarantee that your successful mineral processing depot won't just get drone'd by russia or Ukrainian saboteurs\n\n- A way to get these minerals to market - which also means, rail access from the east to the west of Ukraine - because you won't get them out through the black sea.\n\n- A way to process these minerals in Europe.\n\n\nYou need all of this uncertainty to cost you less than simply making a deal with Canada, Greenland, or somewhere in Africa to give you these minerals.\n\nThe trump team is 0% committed to Ukraine.  This has been obvious for a long, long time.\n\nThose minerals are staying in the ground.",

They had two sources for the rare earth minerals which they forged into magnets in America. China and MP. They only purchased from MP when customers demanded all components sourced from US. The MP minerals were 10x the cost he said. Magnets were the most expensive component of their motors besides assembly (even when they sourced from China).\n\nAll I know is that everything is going to become far more expensive when electric motors become a precious commodity. Motors are currently 50% of all global electricity consumption. Fridges, dishwashers, sinkerators, handicap doors. It’s gonna be nonexistent while the magnets are consumed for more important things like military drones, robot dogs, and electric hummers.\n\nI don’t think MP has a shot in hell to keep up with demand. Idk what the mine looks like, but as a customer of the end product, the demand is going to be so astronomical it is going to break something. Like we are going to have to institute magnet recycling because the demand will be so high.",

Secondly: what makes you think that these companies will be more profitable and better-run than their predecessors?

Will tariffs on competitors and domestic subsidies be enough to offset the fact that the US mining sector is distinctly uncompetitive?",

The U.S. is clearly trying to pull away from China when it comes to rare earths and critical minerals, and MP Materials is one of the only fully integrated players based here. That alone puts them in a prime position.\n\nThe timing is perfect too. Them cutting off shipments to China means they’re confident in handling everything in-house or with U.S.-friendly countries. Add in that Ukraine minerals deal possibly feeding into U.S. refining capacity? That’s a big setup for domestic growth.\n\nPlus, the Section 232 investigation is a real thing. If tariffs hit, domestic producers get an automatic edge. And you already know institutional money and government contracts move stocks way faster than retail hype ever could.\n\nOnly thing is MP still volatile as hell. A lot of this hinges on policy actually turning into purchase orders. If things slow down or shift politically, price action could snap the other way. And $800K is a serious position — size like that in a small sector means exits aren’t always clean if things go south.\n\nStill, the play is solid. They’re aligning with federal energy, defense, and trade goals, and the long-term runway looks real. I’d just say keep an eye on those next policy moves and earnings reports. If MP shows they’re making real margin from domestic refining, this thing could rip.",

        "body": "TL;DR: The official government predictions that predict whether we are in recession or not will come out April 30th. GDP Numbers for Q1 are reported and estimates for Q2 are released from April 30th by the BEA and Atlanta Fed. Q2 estimates will be negative because of the 90 day tariff extension and the market hasn’t realized it yet. \n\n#GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\n\nChances are, we have been in a recession since January 1st. This will become very apparent after April 30th. Not because of the Q1 QDP report, but because of the Q2 estimates that begin to be released that day. Current expectations are for slight growth in Q2, but there’s good reason to think otherwise and news hits that GDP will detract, it will bring the market down and fit the definition of a recession that is two quarters of negative GDP growth. \n\n##What has already happened:\n\nAt the end of last February, aka the last market high, the [Atlanta Fed rapidly started dropping their GDP Now estimates](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow.aspx), why? Because of the sharp spike in imports to the United States to preempt Trump's tariffs. That’s the moment the market started taking Trump's tariff seriously and acting on it. From that moment, we knew we would have at least one negative quarter of GDP growth, but it takes two to tango and as long as Q2 wouldn't be negative as well, we would avoid fitting the definition of a recession. From this info, we know that when tariffs are announced for a future date, firms will import ahead of time to get around it. \n\n\n\n##What is yet to happen:\n\nWhat would cause Q2 to be negative if importers already imported everything ahead of liberation day? Well the only thing I can think of that would push us down that route would be if the majority of the tariffs got pushed back by exactly one quarter at the beginning of April, say- I don't know ***90 days***, like exactly before the end of Q2 so that importers had another opportunity to import more before the tariffs kick in again. Like specifically if I had to cause a recession, that'd be my play book. Announce tariffs to kill one quarter of GDP growth, and then push them back exactly one quarter to kill the next. Genius.\n\nHere’s what I expect is going to happen that hasn’t been priced in yet: importers are going to create another large net export trade deficit to get around the 90 day trigger, consumption will decrease as Americans brace for a recession, and we are going to have a second negative quarter despite all expectations. \n\n\n##What it means:\n\nWhy is fitting the actual definition of a recession bad? (you ask, retardedly) Because it kills the fucking vibes. Consumers react to what's in the news. These things compound on each other, consumption is another component of GDP. If one quarter is down 3% and the next quarter is +0.1%? Recession narrowly avoided a la the 2022 Vibesession. The next quarter is down -0.1%? We're cooked, because that's when news agencies go from nebulous articles about \"the possibly of a recession\" to \"freak the fuck out and panic sell everything, we are officially in a recession right now\". Technically the soonest the government would officially call a recession that started in 2025 is July 30th, 30 days after Q2 ends when the reports get dropped. \n\nHere's the flip side, if the GDP estimates *don't* go negative throughout Q2, it will take a long time for another recession risk to form. The two negative quarters have to be consecutive to meet the definition. There would have to be *another* two quarters of negative GDP growth to kill that. So if numbers don't look bad after April 30th, bulls are gonna win this one. \n\nHere's how I'll be wrong: importers sit on their ass and don't import before the 90 day extension is up, because they already filled warehouses in Q1 or they just don't care. OR, foreign countries begin \"kissing his ass\", a deal gets struck and the tariffs come down. OR, a cosmic particle strikes the neurons in Trump's head like a transistor flipping in a Super Mario speedrun and he takes them all down. \n\n##How we will know:\n\nHere's the key part of how all this gets called. The Bureau of Economic Analysis [releases their first official GDP report](https://www.bea.gov/news/schedule) for a quarter 30 days after that quarter ends, and the Atlanta FED begins releasing their estimates for the current quarter 30 days after it begins. That means **April 30th** is the day of days when we will know the final numbers for Q1, which will be bad, and we will know the estimates for Q2. **If the Q2 estimates are bad on April 30th, that is the same as the Atlanta Fed predicting a recession.** This is what we don't know, but based on how importers reacted last time to change in tariffs, and how the Fed reacted to them, I would imagine this brings down GDP estimates. \n\n##Assumptions I am making:\n\n-The definition of a recession as two quarters of negative GDP growth is a good and accurate definition, and that people will freak out when we are projected to meet that definition. \n\n-A large amount of trade deals won’t get made in the next quarter. \n\n-Importers will create a large trade deficit that brings down GDP because of the 90 day tariff extension. \n\n-The market hasn’t already priced this in. \n\nThere’s plenty of reasons to expect one of those assumptions to be wrong. Do your own DD. Tell me how I’m wrong below. \n\nPositions: 100% Money Market since January. \n\nMy order: I'll get a biggie meal deal with the Double stack, because its the same amount of meat as a Dave's single and I can add toppings for free. Also I have this coupon for baconator fries, please. \n",

This plus upcoming potential legislation to reduce corporate taxes makes it hard to tell exactly how companies will react and forecast across the board. \n\nOne part that people are generally underestimating is the student loan collection impact happening simultaneously with inflationary tariffs. Consumer spending is going to go down no matter what and now its compounded. \n\nMy bet is meme stocks will get obliterated over the next year and supply chain focused retail will take a huge hit. Global software companies like Meta or Google won't because the corporate tax cut cancels the other negative impact. Sure they may drop but just from fear and not very far. Walmart with 24% COGS and 60% imports from China while mostly of their revenue is US based AND consumer spending from a demographic with less money to begin with is basically screwed.",

Meta tried again recently with $1B, and FTC still told him to pound sand — and now Trump’s basically said “go for the throat” and gave the FTC the OK to take this to trial.\n\n\nZuck thought getting buddy-buddy with 🥭(donated $1M to his inauguration, settled a $25M lawsuit, etc.) would help, but nope. Dude spent 10 hours in the hot seat this week, sweating.\n\nMeta definitely won’t sell instagram and WhatsApp it’s such prized asset for them, but would they really pay $18B? \n\nThis feels like it could be a huge overhang for Meta, especially if the trial drags or gets ugly. That said, Meta always shrugs off this kind of crap and prints money anyway.\n\nIs this real enough for a puts play or is it Priced in? \n\nAnyone playing this or sitting back eating cold tendies?\n",

I remember during that whole VR/metaverse hype, I bought in way too high thinking I was early to the next big thing... and then watched it drop like a rock. Sat on it for months thinking I made a huge mistake, but then they shifted focus back to ads and AI, and the stock started crawling back. Felt like I was riding a rollercoaster blindfolded.\n\nNow with this trial, I’m torn. On one hand, government heat is never great news, but on the other, if Zuck pulls off another pivot or wins in court, this thing might bounce. I’m not going all in or anything, but might grab a few more shares on the dip if it keeps sliding. I’ve learned not to bet the farm on any single play, but hey, if I’m gonna lose money, might as well be on a company that keeps making headlines. What’s everyone else thinking? Sit tight or YOLO on the next red candle?",

        "body": "\nThere’s chatter that Elon might finally “refocus” on Tesla and distance himself from his side quests—most notably his weird obsession with Dogecoin. Bulls might think this is bullish: “He’s coming back! He’s serious again!”\n\nBut here’s the problem: he never left. He just stopped delivering.\n\n🚫 Overpromising Is the Default Under Elon\n\nEven if Elon announces he’s giving up on crypto clownery to zero in on Tesla, the core issue remains—his leadership style has fundamentally eroded trust.\n\nLet’s look at the record:\n\t•\tFSD “next year” since 2016 – still in beta, still not delivering revenue.\n\t•\tRobotaxis by 2020 – we’re halfway through 2025.\n\t•\t$25K Model? Vaporware.\n\t•\tCybertruck timeline? Delays, recalls, meme features (like bulletproof claims).\n\nSo, sure, maybe he tweets “I’m all-in on Tesla again,” but the Street has been burned too many times to believe it without tangible execution.\n\nSentiment Doesn’t Flip With a Tweet\n\nThe bigger issue? People just don’t like him anymore. And that matters.\n\t•\tHe’s aligned himself with culture war politics that have turned off core EV buyers.\n\t•\tHis Twitter/X activity has been erratic, controversial, and alienating.\n\t•\tESG investors and climate-focused funds are increasingly bailing on TSLA—not because of performance, but because they can’t sell “Elon” to clients anymore.\n\nSaying “I’m focused now” doesn’t undo years of brand damage.\n\n\n⚠️ Tariffs Are Still Crushing the Global Thesis\n\nEven if Elon dials back the meme coins, the fundamentals don’t magically improve:\n\t•\tUS-EV tariffs are active (and Chinese LFP battery costs just went up).\n\t•\tChina just nuked S/X listings.\n\t•\tEU could retaliate with their own tariffs.\n\t•\tAnd Tesla is retreating from markets like Japan, UK, and Australia by discontinuing models.\n\nThis is structural. No PR pivot will fix supply chain pressure and margin hits.\n\n🤔 Could Elon Turn It Around?\n\nIn theory, yes. If he:\n\t•\tDelivered a real $25K model in 12–18 months.\n\t•\tPartnered with OEMs for FSD licensing.\n\t•\tCleaned up comms, stepped back from X, and re-focused the brand.\n\t•\tResigned as CEO and brought in an operations-focused leader.\n\nBut let’s be real—Elon stepping aside from Dogecoin is not the same as stepping aside from being Elon. And his entire brand is built around showmanship, not execution.\n\n\nBottom Line\n\nEven if Elon says he’s back, we’ve heard that song before—and the market’s tolerance for vapor promises is exhausted. Tesla is:\n\t•\tA retreating brand.\n\t•\tLosing trust.\n\t•\tStill battling macro and regulatory headwinds.\n\nTalk is cheap. Tariffs aren’t.\n\n(Not financial advice. Just tired of waiting for the $25K Tesla.)",

You need *one model*, *one time window*, and the *discipline* to wait for it.\n\nThe market isn’t a competition. You’re not here to beat someone else. You’re here to *see clearly* — and that only happens when you stop overloading your brain.\n\nHere’s the truth: the model only shows up clean once, if you're lucky. And when you force it three more times a day, that’s not strategy — that’s ego.\n\nThat’s the game. One trade. One setup. One clear shot.\n\nConsistency doesn’t come from doing more — it comes from knowing when to do nothing.\n\nJust some things I've been thinking heading into this new week. Happy trading y'all",

        "body": "TL;DR\nTesla’s “rise on bad earnings” is a dead meme. Those rare pops were driven by hype bombs that aren’t coming this time. Now, with public sentiment in the gutter, no guidance, tariff pain, Elon over-promising fatigue, and Model S/X getting pulled globally… this earnings is a setup for a brutal downside move.\n\n⸻\n\n🧟 “BUT TSLA RISES ON BAD NEWS!” – NOT ANYMORE\n\nLet’s shut this down:\n\t•\tQ4 2024 is the only real exception: Tesla missed both revenue and EPS but rose ~4% only because Elon teased a June robotaxi launch and new low-cost model plans.\n\t•\tThat bounce came after hours, only after the call—purely driven by forward guidance.\n\t•\tWithout those surprise announcements? TSLA always drops on a miss.\n\nThere is no consistent historical pattern of Tesla going up on bad earnings without major forward-looking hype. That’s not a trend. That’s luck + hopium.\n\n⸻\n\n⚠️ THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT – IN THE WORST WAY\n\n1. No Guidance, No Hype, No Lifeline\n\t•\tNo Model 2.\n\t•\tNo robotaxi demo.\n\t•\tNo solid FSD timeline.\n\t•\tLast call? Elon basically said “we’re not giving forward guidance anymore.”\n\n2. Elon Over-Promising = Worn Out\n\t•\tPromised Full Self-Driving “next year” since 2016. Still in beta.\n\t•\tRobotaxis by 2020. Nope.\n\t•\t“$25K Tesla soon.” Still nothing.\n\t•\tInvestors have heard it all, and they’re not buying it anymore without real action.\n\n3. Public Sentiment Is TRASH\n\t•\tMusk’s alliance with Trump has alienated core Tesla buyers and ESG-focused investors.\n\t•\tHe’s become a culture war figure, not an innovation icon.\n\t•\tHis Dogecoin pumping and Twitter chaos have made Tesla feel more like a meme than a market leader.\n\t•\tGoogle Trends, Twitter mentions, and retail chatter have all cooled significantly—there’s no positive sentiment tailwind this time.\n\n⸻\n\n🧨 GLOBAL MODEL PULLBACKS = BAD SIGNALS\n\nTesla is literally discontinuing products in multiple markets:\n\t•\tModel S & X canceled in Australia, New Zealand, UK, and Japan due to ending right-hand-drive production.\n\t•\tChina pulled U.S.-made Model S/X from its website—no more “Order Now” buttons. Tariffs are biting.\n\t•\tU.S. killed off Model 3 RWD, its cheapest EV, because Chinese-made LFP battery tariffs made it unprofitable.\n\nThis is not growth. This is retreat.\n\n⸻\n\n🔥 TARIFF WAR = MARGIN SLAUGHTER\n\t•\t10% U.S. tariffs on EVs are in effect, and reciprocals from the EU and China are brewing.\n\t•\tTesla’s global footprint means they’re hit from all sides.\n\t•\tElon himself admitted tariffs are “significant.” Translation: margins getting choked.\n\n⸻\n\n📉 OPTIONS + VOLATILITY\n\t•\tMarket is pricing a ±9% move.\n\t•\tSkew is to the downside: when there’s no guidance and sentiment is weak, implied vol favors bearish plays.\n\n⸻\n\n⚠️ DISCLAIMER\n\nThis post represents my personal opinion and is for entertainment and discussion purposes only. This is not financial advice. Do your own research, and don’t sue me if you go full YOLO and end up eating instant ramen for a month.\n\n⸻\n\nTLDR of the TLDR:\nNo hype, no guidance, no goodwill.\nJust Elon baggage, global retrenchment, and macro headwinds.\nShort the clown car.",

This company will be heavily impacted by tarriffs as your expensive beans don’t come from your grandpas farm in Kansas. If there’s an economic slowdown the first thing to go will be your 7$ cup of coffee on the way to work because you lost your job. Higher labor costs for the company caused by unions will continue to be a drag. Maxwell beans going to be selling like hotcakes as people look for cheaper coffee at DG. The bright spot is oil is cheap so the actual shipping cost may be less. \n\nTechnicals\n\n50 day ema crossed the 200 this week. 50 day  ema crossed 90 last week. Large outflows even on up days such as today. The stock is up about 2.4% right now and large order flow of sells is 2.92 million and buy sits around 1.5 million. If you’re into math that’s about 50% difference. The big guys are selling and the retailers buying 24.6 mil vs selling 21.8 mil. May find some support around 74. \n\nWhat am I missing?\n",

        "body": "Alphabet reports first-quarter earnings after today's closing bell. They're the second earnings report among the Magnificent Seven stocks which I'll be posting about on each of their earning days. Alphabet is following Tesla, which, despite disappointing results, gained after news of Elon Musk's increased involvement in the company's operations. \n\nSo for GOOG, are we going in on calls or puts? I figured we'd at least need to be informed with what's in the know before deciding. In light of the widespread weakness among leading Big Tech companies (all of these companies have experienced higher declines than the broader US market since the beginning of the year), today's Alphabet earnings will be a significant test of how the company operates in a new environment dominated by uncertainty. I'm not only going to be interested in the financial data but I wanna see the message from the management indicating to investors whether Alphabet is navigating safely through our currently uncertain market.\n\n**The Chart**\n\nFrom a [TA perspective](https://i.imgur.com/uE3nJVz.png) a double bottom pattern may be forming on Alphabet's chart. If today's earnings results turn out to be a positive surprise and the stock price climbs above the $160.77 level, it could signal a reversal of the downward trend that has been affecting the tech giant's shares since the beginning of 2025. \n\n**Earnings**\n\nFor Q1, it looks like the market is expecting Alphabet to report revenue of $89.1 billion (+11% y/y). From what I've read, operating income is expected to reach $28.58 billion (+12% y/y). This stronger profit growth implies a slight margin improvement to above 32.08% (+0.45 pp). Tbh, it looks like effective cost management will be one of the biggest challenges for Alphabet in this environment. While sustaining strong revenue growth seems less at risk, managing expenses (especially given capital-intensive AI development plans) will be challenging.\n\n**Cloud Services**\n\nFor those who are aware, Google Cloud is a thing and is driving massive growth for the company. With rivals signaling a slowdown in data center expansion amid rising uncertainty, Alphabet may either follow a cautious strategy (likely dampening growth) or seize the opportunity to gain market share by acting aggressively.\n\nThe second approach would be riskier and more costly, potentially causing erosion in the segment’s operating margin. It would, however, be an investment in the better future market position.\n\nI'm going to be watching not just the quarterly results but also the forward outlook and management’s tone regarding the Cloud business. It looks like the Forecasted Cloud segment has a revenue of $12.32 billion for Q1 2025. This would be the h[ighest quarterly result in Alphabet's history](https://i.imgur.com/9uWUntD.png). However, operating income is expected to slightly decline versus the prior quarter, but at $1.94 billion it would still be over twice the result from Q1 2024.\n\n**Tariffs** \n\nOne of the key topics that I'll especially be closely watching tonight is the impact of tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty on the company’s operations. Among the major Big Tech companies, Alphabet has shown the greatest resilience to potential geopolitical turmoil and has often demonstrated the fastest recovery following periods of uncertainty.\n\nAt this point, they do not appear to be in significantly better shape than its peers, with its stock down approximately 17% year-to-date, placing it squarely in the middle of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nI think the first step toward rebuilding investor confidence will be outlining the scope and impact of tariffs and overall geopolitical uncertainty on the company’s operations. As such, the types of questions I expect during today’s conference about how strongly tariffs will affect Alphabet’s business. It is worth noting that this isn’t necessarily about the direct impact (which is likely to be limited) but rather the indirect effect of uncertainty on the willingness of Alphabet’s clients to spend on advertising, which constitutes a significant portion of the company’s revenue.\n\n**Price Targets**\n\nAmid these earnings expectations, analysts have been revising Alphabet's price targets downward. Over the past few weeks, [several top analysts have revised their 12-month price targets for Alphabet](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/goog/forecast?utm_source=theglobeandmail.com&utm_medium=referral). TD Cowen lowered its target from $210 to $195. UBS cut its target from $209 to $173. Even Scotiabank lowered its target from $232 to $200. Despite that, they all still rate GOOG stock as a Buy, showing they believe in its long-term value.\n\nGuggenheim lowered its target from $215 to $190, while Jefferies adjusted its target from $235 to $200, both maintaining a Buy rating. Piper Sandler and Citi followed suit, reducing their targets to $185 and $195 respectively, citing uncertainties in the advertising landscape and macroeconomic pressures.\n\nI mean. With all things considered, the stock is down 19% in 2025 so far. Combine that with rising legal risks (mentioned later here) and an uncertain economy, and you have a good reason to reframe expectations. Analysts aren’t necessarily predicting more downside; they’re just being more realistic about the upside, especially in the near term.\n\nIf we’re to simplify the analysts’ overall message, it’s that Alphabet’s fundamentals are strong, but the road ahead could be bumpy.\n\n**In the news**\n\nA federal court recently ruled that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing specific digital advertising markets. The court plans to determine suitable remedies soon. Some analysts believe the ruling could eventually lead to the divestiture of certain Google ad segments, though the financial impact on Alphabet is expected to be modest.\n\nThere’s also the bigger picture. Between global tariffs, economic uncertainty, and shifts in labor and costs across the tech industry, Alphabet has a lot on its plate. Investors will want to hear how the company manages expenses, hiring, and regional exposure.\n\n**Mergers and Acquisitions**\n\nAlphabet announced a $32 billion all-cash deal to acquire cloud security platform Wiz. This acquisition aims to enhance Google Cloud’s security capabilities and multi-cloud operations. Analysts are projecting long-term benefits from this acquisition, despite potential short-term market pressures on other cloud service providers.\n\nSeparately, Google has decided to maintain its current approach to offering third-party cookie choices in its Chrome browser, emphasizing the importance of online privacy and user control. This decision is part of Google's ongoing Privacy Sandbox initiative, which aims to strengthen online privacy while supporting a sustainable ad-driven internet environment.\n\n**What now?**\n\nAlphabet’s stock may be down, but most analysts still believe it’s a long-term winner. That’s why Buy ratings remain steady, even if price targets are down. Q1 earnings could be the reset moment Alphabet needs to win back momentum. I'm thinking short term puts for earnings but holding long term shares. Could even sell covered calls for earnings for some extra income, if you already have the shares. Avg price target is $204.",

        "body": "Abstract: By analyizing economic data it is clear that we are in the early stages of another financial crisis similar in scope to 2008's. The data surrounding debt and consumer savings all point to the same eventuality, that even without tariffs the economy has been held up by a string since before covid.\n\nIntroduction: While tariffs are at the forefront of everyone's conversations surrounding a possible recession, something much darker has been brewing in the background. Debt. In 2008 banks failed primarily due to Mortgage Backed Securities and Collateralized Debt Obligations failing as a result of defaults on mortgages rising. None of the people responsible ever faced any true consequences and many are still part of the financial system to this day (Scott Besset). I've been doing my own personal due diligence on the state of the economy and have come to the conclusion that no one learned their lesson. As a result, they're making the same mistakes all over again.\n\nWhat banks are doing: CDO's and MBS's are extremely profitable for banks and investment firms to hold. Theyre basically large tranches of debt stacked together and sold off as a bond. After they failed in 2008 you would think that the banks would stop investing heavily into these instruments since they collapsed the world economy 17 years ago. They haven't. Speaking to a head portfolio manager at BNY I learned they're still heavily invested in these and have added in more consumer debt, credit card debt, and business loan debt called Collateralized Loan Obligations. While the manager seemed optimistic about the investments something he said stuck out to me when I asked about the rising rates of defaults.\n\n\"The Bank will be ok\"\n\nThe BANK will be ok. He danced around it but admitted they were concerned over the rising rates, but the emphasis on the bank being ok made me realize, \"what about everyone else?\". The banks know that they will be bailed out if something happens, they were bailed out in 2008, and during covid JPOW turned the money printer on to keep things moving. They're banking on the idea that even though the bonds are known to be dangerous, the government will step in if things go south.\n\nThis is the \"Too big to fail\" mindset.\n\nDebt Defaults: Everythings expensive. We went through 2 years of high inflation. While companies burned through the money they got during the covid years they are now laying off workers en masse, especially in the tech sector. This combines into people putting more and more on their credit cards due to inflation making things more expensive, then not being able to pay off those purchases since they were laid off.\n\nThis is the data from FRED\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6516pl79nwwe1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=658d8292a78f506723ce5c0b8d3395ac3b227e97\n\nWhile in the years following 2008 credit card defaults/deliquencies fell (sharply after covid due to stimulus and not going out and buying things), they've recently begun to rise, coinciding with inflation rising. This directly affects the CDO's and CLO's that banks are so in love with.\n\n\n\nConsumer Savings: People aren't saving as much as they were pre pandemic, the personal savings was around 6% pre-covid, now its bouncing around 3%.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxypa2ecnwwe1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=a602208dcd85fe32536bb6fbfb18957b42cb86cf\n\nThis leads me to believe that people have less and less money in savings, causing them to put more on credit cards.\n\nTangent, klarna terrifies me, putting a burrito on afterpay is dystopic.\n\nConsumer Debt levels: Consumer debt is hitting all time highs, its not going to slow down anytime soon, there's too much money in it for banks to NOT lend to people.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnsvw0bdnwwe1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=63f8fc29b8d04c94ae114cb0df38c7e82f588342\n\nGDPnow Report: I know the markets are disconnected from logic at this point, but the AtlantaFed's GDPnow has been predicting negative growth since Feburary, the most recent estimate is -2.5% down from a 3.5% growth in January. I think -2.5% is a little low, but even if its off by a full 1% its still negative growth for the quarter. Proof that the economy is stagnating.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ultemjwenwwe1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=858aa22df07f1078d3b602670eb746f7ab282d84\n\nConclusion, Im just an Econ major. My professors all share the same view, that we are in the early days of a recession. All this evidence isn't even accounting for the volatility of the current climate surrounding tariffs. I lost my job due to DOGE along with 200,000 other federal employees. Theyre paying us out until September to try and keep government spending up in hopes that it wont fuck with the GDP too much.\n\nTLDR: Puts will print In the coming months\n\nHeres my positions: don't make fun of them, I'm a college student, I keep all my money in Pokémon cards.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrhob9bgnwwe1.png?width=2116&format=png&auto=webp&s=41977263aa49a42c10d5cf2cd5f1a1271964c8f9\n\n",

                "body": "This reads like someone who googled a few things and watched the big short as their DD. \n\n\nFirst off, CDOs and MBS played a role in the 2008 crash for sure but, comparing CLOs with them oversimplifies things. CLOs are mainly made up of corporate loans, not subprime mortgages or consumer credit card debt. Yes, they are tranches of debt packaged and sold off like bonds, but they operate differently and have different default profiles. Also CLOs performed better than CDOs during the 2008 crash. If you're comparing the two products as if they're the same thing you really don't know what you're talking about. \n\n\nSecond, the rising credit card delinquency rate you show is worth paying attention to but it's rising off of historic lows. Stimulus payments, pandemic-related spending drops, and a strong post COVID labor market kept delinquencies artificially low. Now, as things normalize, delinquencies are climbing back toward pre-pandemic levels. concerning, maybe, but it’s not clear that we’re seeing a trend that guarantees a system-wide collapse. You’re estimating the trajectory, but the magnitude isn’t really alarming when you look at long term charts.\n\nThird, while the personal savings rate has fallen compared to the early COVID years, it’s still within the range seen in the 2000s. The pandemic created an artificial bump in savings from the money printer and reduced spending, so it’s not quite fair to treat the decline as an absolute warning sign. What would be more useful is to pair the savings data with income growth and inflation-adjusted consumer spending like if wages are flatlining while spending rises and savings fall. That data would probably help your argument more.\n\nAnother issue is the GDPNow projection. You be leaning on that Atlanta Fed model a little too hard. It’s a nowcasting model that fluctuates frequently and doesn’t carry the same weight as two consecutive quarters of real GDP decline or a broad-based slowdown across leading economic indicators. Using a -2.5% GDPNow projection from a single point in time as proof of economic stagnation is pure reguard behavior. \n\nAlso no mention of monetary policy? How can you forget Daddy Jerome Powell.  The Federal Reserve still has tools it can use to prop up the economy. If delinquencies spike and consumer debt becomes a drag, they can and will begin cutting rates again. That doesn’t solve the structural problems you’re pointing out, but it will delay the fallout and keep things looking stable short term. If this information is really coming from your professors I would change schools.",

Copper suffered a weekslong selloff before recouping some of the declines.\n\n\nOil prices crashed to a four-year low below $60 a barrel in London on April 9, days after Trump unveiled his tariffs and OPEC+ announced a larger-than-expected supply increase. Futures have subsequently rebounded amid signs that physical crude markets are still tight, trading near $67 a barrel on Thursday. But they still remain about 10% lower from the end of last month.\n\n\nWith no set risk limits, it isn’t uncommon for Andurand’s Discretionary Enhanced fund to see such swings in its returns. Over the last three years, the strategy has been through double-digit gains and losses.”\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-24/andurand-hedge-fund-s-losses-worsen-to-52-after-april-turmoil?utm_medium=email&utm_source=author_alert&utm_term=250424&utm_campaign=author_19458291&sref=pShhn61A&embedded-checkout=true",

If you're levered 3x and the stock loses 25% of it's value in a day, you are now levered 3/.75 = 4x! The ETF has to sell shares to get back to being 3x levered.\n\nSo as a holder of the ETF that loses 25% of it's value, you would likely have \\~4x exposure at the opening auction. \n\nDepending on the ETF, they might do a rebalance at, or during, the opening auction. The rebalance will require them to sell a lot of their shares, which could further push the price down.\n\nHope that helps!",

This would be the biggest single-day jump in recent memory.\n\n**Why is this important? Because it's a leading indicator that the recession might have just begun.**  \nBasically if you look at all the previous recessions (marked on the chart with grey patches), what marked the beginning of each one was this yield curve going vertical. Which it might have just started doing. \n\nKeep an eye on these two charts the rest of this week. If the trend continues, we might be seeing the start of a real shitshow, indicating a much higher level of systemic instability and risk, starting in supply chains and logistics but with the potential to ripple outwards through the debt and equity markets.

        "body": "Tesla is releasing their earnings tonight, and because they tend to move quite a bit with earnings, I wanted to see if we could try to bet on it. Either calls or puts.\n\nTesla generally moves ±10%, and shot up last two earnings but down badly the one prior in July 2024. \n\nFor tonight's first-quarter earnings and revenue, from what I've read, it looks like a lot of analysts are *already* predicting poor results. They see see EPS down 9% to 41 cents a share, though more recent forecasts point to a further slide. Revenue should fall a fraction to $21.27 billion, with the sharp consensus pointing to a 7% decline to $19.76 billion. Tesla Q1 consensus earnings projections have come down more than 40% since the end of 2024. The Q1 EPS target was $3.31 just before Tesla's Q4 earnings release.\n\nWhat's interesting is that in Q4, Tesla's net income was boosted by a recent change in how companies account for holdings of digital currencies. This policy change resulted in an earnings per share add-on of 68 cents in Q4, with a net income increase of $600 million. So the price of corn could actually really influence the results today.\n\n[The company delivered 336,681 EVs in Q1](https://www.investors.com/news/tesla-stock-market-tesla-deliveries/), down 13% vs. a year earlier and the lowest since Q2 2022. They fell 32.1% vs. Q4's record 495,570 EVs. The bright spot is Tesla China, where sales appeared to edge higher vs. a year earlier, but those tend to be lower margin. U.S. and European sales have tumbled on Musk's brand woes. Tesla also deployed 10.4 gigawatt-hours of energy storage products in Q1, down slightly vs. Q4's record 11 GWh but up 156% vs. a year earlier.\n\nI've looked at a few articles regarding EVs, it looks like auto gross margins excluding regulatory tax credits of 13.1%, compared to 16.4% a year ago. The average selling price per vehicle coming in at $37,910 in Q1, down from $43,790 in Q1 2024.\n\nSo this is what I'm expecting for today: As usual, the focus will be on Elon and the earnings call. Tesla is also changing things up and have said \"in addition to posting first quarter results\" it \"will hold a live company update and question and answer\" session. What this means is anybody's best guess. He in the past has repeatedly said earnings calls are not for product announcements. Could this mean he'll give significant details on the new affordable vehicle? Or could it be similar to the recent all-hands company meeting where he told employees to hold onto their Tesla stock, touting the future of artificial intelligence and robotics?\n\nIn any case, I'm more-so interested to see if he sticks to his forecast for unsupervised, self-driving ride hailing in Austin this June, any details about the \"affordable\" vehicle, if he sees delivery growth in 2025 after a weak Q1 and sluggish start to April and what are his plans around his work with the Trump White House. Honestly all this Trump stuff has seemingly [hurt sales](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/tesla-deliveries-drop-13-amid-backlash-ceo-elon/story?id=120412167) and dropped the stock. But there isn't really much we can know about the precise impact on Tesla’s bottom line until tonight. \n\nIt's already been reported that Tesla will delay its upcoming \"affordable\" EV by at least three months. Tesla had said it planned production of a lower-cost vehicle by mid-year, but various reports had suggested it would come in late 2025 or 2026. The latest report said production will start in the U.S., followed by China and Europe. They have not given any details about the EV, but multiple reports have said it'll be a stripped-down Model Y rather than a new form factor, like a hatchback.\n\nI honestly think he needs to leave government and be a full-time CEO for Tesla. Right now his temporary status as a government employee expires next month, so he will face questions about his plans during the call. He really needs to lay out the timeline/hard facts around the rollout of autonomous vehicles and robotics over the next 6-12 months. I want answers on when the new lower cost vehicle will hit the production line. Honestly, if he chooses to stay with the government it could change the future of Tesla/brand damage will grow. Not good. \n\nIn addition to this, rival automakers saw huge sales gains as consumers pushed up purchases to avoid tariffs, which began on April 2. Tesla's main rival overseas, BYD, has been eating into Tesla's market share for some time now. So with this, I'm considering puts or a put spread. Considering the stock is up 6%, puts are at a discount now. Since the stock usually goes up or down 10%, I would target the 230 or 225 strike price with 4/25 exp date. We also have Google earnings on Thursday, so I'm going to be looking at that as well.",

The Setup No One Sees Coming\n\nYou’ve seen this before. Not the chart. The moment. A sharp drop. A confusing headline. Everyone bails. The algorithms freeze. And then, boom - the narrative flips, and everything rips. That’s the setup right now. SPY is down, volatility is up, and everyone’s arguing about tariffs like it’s Econ 101. But underneath that? A $0.14 option is hiding in plain sight. Deep OTM. December expiration. Sitting there like a scratcher ticket no one scratched. This isn’t a normal trade. It’s a cheap swing at a high conviction reversal. The kind of bet that looks dumb right before it doesn’t.\n\nII. Trump Does What Trump Does\n\nTrump negotiates like he’s writing headlines. Go big, go scary, then walk it back and declare victory with a simple tweet. It’s not theory — it’s his playbook: NAFTA, NATO, North Korea, China (round one). Every time: chaos first, deal later. Now he’s back, and he’s swinging tariffs again. The first shot was expected — China. But then he blindsided everyone by going after Canada and Mexico too. Europe followed. Suddenly it wasn’t just a trade policy. It was a global pile-on. But Trump always wants a win. And wins, for him, come fast. If he starts rolling back these tariffs - even if China stays frozen - the market doesn’t need a resolution. It just needs a direction.\n\nIII. What the Math Says\n\nAs of April 17, 2025, SPY closed at $526. The $760 call expiring December 19 is priced at $0.14. Using a projected mark of $678 and the same moneyness ratio (678/760), the equivalent August 15 strike is $590 and closed at $5.15. That $678 level isn’t fantasy. It’s the pre-tariff SPY close of $612 plus the same 10.8% gain SPY posted over the same stretch last year. At a cost of $0.14 and a value of $5.15, the return is 36x.\n\nIV. The COVID Rebound: Redux\n\nThat 2020 move? Everyone remembers it. But instead of a deadly pandemic, it’s a tariff detour that will unwind - no vaccine required - by just two thumbs pecking out a tweet only one man on Earth can - “the tariff war is over - victory is in hand” - DJT. This isn’t a hedge. It’s a shot. A reset bounce puts this $0.14 option in the money with room to run. That’s not moonshot math. That’s just how mispricing works when everyone’s looking the other way. COVID showed us what happens when sentiment flips. This setup’s cheaper, simpler, and it doesn’t need a Fed bazooka or a warp speed cure— just a shift in tone and a headline worth chasing. If you missed out last time – now is your second chance.",

AI, via Gemini 2.0 and DeepMind, powers Search (1.5B users/month) and Cloud, with $75B in AI capex planned. Verily’s health tech and Wing’s drone delivery add diversification.

And that's just a part of the Google portfolio. \n\n\n\n\nYeah, they have a bunch of legal stuff, but so did MS 20-30 years ago and look at them now. \n\n\nYeah, they have some headwinds, but given they're a frontier company in cloud, ai, self driving, search, video and also a bunch of other ubiquitous stuff like maps and Gmail it's crazy how people are sleeping on them. \n\n\nI think their problem is that they're big enough that acquisitions barely make a dent and different segments make so much money that it's very hard for them to even figure. For example they spent like 30B buying that Israeli cybersec company and it barely deserves a mention. ",

Unless they burned through it since their last 10K, they can take another year or more of punishment.\n\n• **Tariffs are overblown:** Strong U.S. ties, Pittsburgh manufacturing, and growing footprint in Africa/Europe help diversify away from Canada risk. Accelerated orders after April 2nd could actually offset some of the Tariff impacts. \n\n**Caveat:** If their cash position tanked since the last 10K, my thesis crumbles. I expect short-term volatility. I’m DCA’ing and using bullish puts when spreads are fat.\n\nNot financial advice. Do your own research. I am an internet stranger with too many tabs open.\n\n  \n",

        "body": "When the specter of tariffs began to take shape, I started loading up on safe-haven assets as a short-term hedge against any volatility in international affairs.  I took out a small position in UGL and a much larger position in GLD, both of which track the gold market.  Most of my purchases were made in late February and early March.  I added some more to those positions in April to take advantage of the upward momentum.\n\nI managed to time the local peak in the spot price of gold rather well.  I closed my UGL position for a six-figure gain.  I am paring my GLD position and will likely be realizing a seven-figure gain once I am finished selling.\n\nI am not quite sure when I will completely rotate out of the latter position, though.  There are a few reasons for this.  Foremost, I still see significant uncertainty with regards to international trade.  I do believe that, in the short term, this will continue to cause the price of gold to rise against a number of currencies.  It is also entirely possible that we could witness a decline and then an aggressive melt up in the price of gold if negotiations break down substantially and the equities market is forced to digest what is effectively a trade embargo against either one or more countries.  For the contrarian view, we are either one tweet, wayward comment, or press conference away from the equities market rallying and the price of gold being temporarily depressed.  All of this uncertainty is additionally being driven by one individual who folds at the slightest bit of resistance.\n\nFor those who are curious about a follow-up play, I added to my holdings of BRK-A with the proceeds from these trades.  I'll be buying more BRK-A after I close my GLD position.",

        "body": "I posted a bit ago about my UNH short that worked out very well, and I've been reluctant to post things that aren't either closed or essentially already played out.  But I figure this one is the last truly spicy one left in my portfolio at the moment and I figured I would share it as well.  As a caveat, this is not investment advice.  My overall portfolio is extremely conservative, so I can take some (fairly crazy) flyers here and there to get a bit of alpha.  \n\n\nI've been (very happily) shorting TSLA in the medium-term.  I can get into the full thesis later if anyone cares (it's not different than a majority of other bear cases on TSLA)  but I started taking positions as soon as Elmo decided giving a Nazi salute was a cool idea.  I like to enter positions with options strategies that are medium to long term (1 month or longer to expiry, a lot of LEAPS usually).  I tend to have a mix of spreads and naked positions.  \n\n\nWith TSLA  I have three positions outstanding.\n\n\n\n(1) April 25 2025 200/230 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 69k several months ago.  My original thinking back when I bought it was to close it before the earning tonights.  Thinking about rolling it outwards at least a week, though it's pretty expensive.  If not, I'm also considerng roughly halving it before market close so that I've got my basis back and I'm just playing with house money on tonight's earnings print.\n\n\n\n(2) May 16 2025 235/250  Bear Put Vertical - paid about 15k the day after Trump cancelled the tariffs, figuring that the bounce upwards was really overpriced. This is another one I may cut in half.\n\n\n\n(3) June 2025 Bear Put Vertical - paid about 200/240 - paid relatively the most for this (40k) last week.  It has a fair bit of time to expiry, so despite the bad pricing, I'm going to let this one ride a bit longer before re-evaluating a trim or closure of the position.  \n\n\n\nAll together, these open positions are about 125k in cost basis, sitting at around 100k in paper profits.  It's bit more risk than I like given the bizarre price action that TSLA exhibits, even when it missed and even when it gives bad but blurry near team guidance.  On the flip side, I think the fundamental story here is really really bleak.  Elon has to successfully sell investors on some new radical fantasyland project to avoid a bad day tomorrow.  I don't think simply saying \"I'm out of politics and focused on my companies\" is going to cut it.",

Each IVF Baby will be in beta as soon as each is three years old. Each will be fully certified when they turn sixteen in the USA, eighteen for most other countries. Elon has 149 fully certified IVF Babies currently, enough for current demand in Austin and Dubai (bet you didn't think he'd been so prolific). There should be a gradual expansion of fully certified IVF Babies coming on board each year, with the supply hitting 500k in sixteen years, 2041. There is about a 27% loss now before full certification, and about a 3% annual loss after, Tesla is working on reducing those numbers. \n\nFootnote: pre-certification happens in test labs and sh*thole countries as defined by the current administration.",

Underlying price / option price * delta will tell you how much leverage this contract is giving you.\n\n\nEDIT: oh wait, this is a call, not a put. Yeah terrible idea.

        "body": "\"Stay away from widowmaker etfs UVIX, UVXY, SQQQ ,SOXS\n\nNegative roll yield and decay are crucial concepts when dealing with leveraged ETFs like SOXS, SQQQ, UVXY, and UVIX. Here's how they apply:\nNegative Roll Yield\n\nRoll yield refers to the return generated when rolling futures contracts forward. It becomes negative when the market is in contango, meaning longer-term futures contracts are more expensive than near-term ones. Since ETFs like UVXY and UVIX track volatility futures, they suffer losses when rolling contracts forward at higher prices. This continuous erosion of value makes them poor long-term investments.\nDecay (Beta Slippage)\n\nDecay, also known as beta slippage, affects leveraged ETFs due to their daily rebalancing. These funds aim to provide multiples of daily returns, but compounding effects cause them to lose value over time, especially in volatile markets. For example:\n\nSQQQ (3x inverse Nasdaq-100) suffers decay because daily percentage moves compound negatively.\n\nUVXY and UVIX (leveraged volatility ETFs) experience extreme decay due to volatility drag.\n\nImpact on SOXS, SQQQ, UVXY, and UVIX\n\nSOXS (3x inverse semiconductor ETF) faces decay due to daily rebalancing.\n\nSQQQ loses value over time unless the Nasdaq consistently declines.\n\nUVXY and UVIX suffer the worst decay due to roll yield and leverage.\n\nThese ETFs are best used for short-term trading, not long-term holding, due to their structural decay. If you're considering them, it's essential to understand their mechanics to avoid unexpected losses.\n\nUVIX, UVXY, SQQQ , SOXS must reverse split to prevent them from going to \" 0 \"\n\nYou will be safer attempting to short individual stocks as opposed to buying something guaranteed to go to zero\"",

However if you're using a 3x leveraged product on the stock, $100 invested on day one will be worth approximately $75.50 on the 10th day.

Telling them, \"See ya at Wendy's!\" (For reasons we all know), but what if, that isn't a bad idea?\n\nWe all have a Wendy's somewhere in our town, and obviously people are still buying burgers, nuggets, the works, as shown in their sales.\n\n[Sales](https://preview.redd.it/8qncms9s4gwe1.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52b2ad8e9483508434f792314cf52046d821f85)\n\nThe share price is at a comfy low P/E of 13, with a lower Forward P/E of 11, which means you're paying close to what the stock is worth as compared to when you look at big tech companies with inflate P/E ratios (Looking at you PLTR and AMD).\n\nWendy's currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, coming to Dividend yield TTM of 8.01%, which beats the yield of many REITs, and not to mention, treasuries (Why buy treasuries when you can buy Wendy's?)\n\nNext on the menu (Get it?) We have Institutional ownership which makes up 88% of the owned shares. Trian Fund Management and Vanguard are big names with a huge stake in this old American company, it's not likely they are going to cut their stake between considering the dividend yield and their own sunk cost into investing in it.\n\n[Ownership](https://preview.redd.it/s3ie22uv4gwe1.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddf01a25de881a2e9b0e679c84ef3610c613d18f)\n\nLastly, the special sauce. I went to the effort of drawing these lines so you don't have to. I expect to see $WEN between $16-$24 per share within the next 3 years, maintaining their current dividend yield as well (I am expecting a 40% ROI + 8%/Year for 48% after 3 years).\n\n[Crayons](https://preview.redd.it/zg15ko965gwe1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d7163eef48a4b80773acfdbf1b3de407d5190f)\n\n  \nThat being said, you guys are probably thinking...BORING! Where's the moonshot? Why wait that long? Well, I got an answer for you. I personally believe I am overestimating the time it will take to see these numbers. When enough people catch on that Wendy's is a heck of a value play, it's only going to drive the share price up into a upwards snowball, at least until the yield and P/E isn't tempting enough (Like they're Dave Singles).\n\nAnyways, that is my DD for now on $WEN. Opened a position of 4 $14 Calls for June, and bought 36 shares. Going to invest more as I obtain more capital inflow, targeting making this at least 5% of my portfolio within the next 6 months.\n\n  \nPOSITION SCREENSHOTS:\n\n[Shares](https://preview.redd.it/rbugvgjz4gwe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc6f409643194991a2886e46280bca3da0490ae1)\n\n[Options](https://preview.redd.it/6vf3nn815gwe1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92c9178cddb77640d2523d37d4272991382110b4)\n\n  \n\n\nRegards,\n\nNalon McCallough",

WEN earns $0.95 but pays a $1 dividend, with only $233mm in free cash flow.\n\nAdditionally, WEN is primarily a franchisee, not a restaurant owner. There are about 7,000 shops, but WEN only owns (owned) 400. But they are not growing the franchise. WEN announced they are shutting 100 of their own stores, and they had 2 large franchise operators go bankrupt recently. The majority of the remaining franchisees own less than 10 stores.\n\nHey, I hate to be a buzz kill, and I hope you make money, but I think that dividend is at risk of being cut, which is never taken kindly by shareholders.\n\nAlso, dont make the mistake of comparing a fast food company with 8% margins and 1,500% debt to equity to a tech company with 60% margins and no net debt...its a little cringy",

(GLD trade hasn't settled yet at the time of writing this).\n\nMy strategy is to purchase 5-10 DTE options, based on a careful mix of DD, Donie Truths, and gut instinct. I always give my thesis time to play and I ALWAYS take my profits - I never let the thesis fully play out, if I earn $5K+ unrealized profit on a play, I start planning the exit trade. There are plenty of trades that could have been monstrous if I held to maturity, but there were also a few that would have wiped me out if I held.\n\nAlso high volatility, means you pay higher premiums. Please be wary of this - some of these 1-2 DTE options I see for break evens that would be 3 or 4 standard deviation events in a normal market irk me out. You can easily fall victim to significant Theta (time value decay) if your positions don’t leave you with enough time to exit.\n\nFor example, on a recent trade I bought 200 x GLD $300 PUTS expiring May 9th on April 24th. I felt Gold was in an overbought position, reviewing the 1-month chart, RSM, and again using gut instinct and Donnie vibes that have recently ushered in a new market optimism. The next day, GLD drops to 2%+ to $301 at the open and I sell for a $30k+ profit.\n\nI’ll continue to post my journey on the road to a Milli… that’s my exit strategy, after I get to $1M I’m writing iron condors for premiums and FIRING away.\n\nGood luck to all of the regards out there, and let me know what you think about this strategy!",

Notably, Reality Labs posted a $5 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2024, contributing to the restructuring decisions. Despite this, CEO Mark Zuckerberg remains steadfast in his support for the company’s long-term strategy centered on augmented and virtual reality technologies. ​\n\nThese layoffs come amid continued challenges in Meta's hardware and gaming sectors. While sales of Meta's smart glasses with Ray-Ban have grown faster than the company expected, Quest headset sales have continued to struggle. \n\nThe latest Quest 3S, released last fall, is currently on sale for roughly 10 percent off in some configurations",

I think the paper is a MUST READ not because there is a lot to learn from it, but because you should be prepared what the admin thinks, so get prepared.\n\nI want to discuss one idea from the paper, even though many topics are worth discussing:\n\nHe says tariffs are usually paid by the exporting nation (companies in that nation) only if currency is offset by the same percentage as the tariff. Example:\n\n1 - Imported good price is $10 pre trariff ->\n\n2 - Dollar value is up 10%, so that same good now costs $9 ->\n\n3 - Tariff added of 10% for that good now makes it $9.9 (we call it same price basically)\n\nSo his point is that tariffs can be offset this way, so consumer pays basically the same price but $1 goes to the treasury, thus exporting nation (company) basically paid the tariff and U.S. gets additional revenue.\n\nI think this is kind of misleading for the reason: Mathematically what he says is true, but **burden is still shared by the consumer and the exporting nation in this case**, not only by exporting nation. Consumer is still \"robbed\" of the opportunity to buy the good for $9 and capitalize from dollar valuation, instead he pays same price and not getting any benefit from it. I understand that possibly this revenue from tariffs will bring some of the taxes down (yet to see?), but not to the point that you would be compensated and still pay $9 for the same product.\n\nHe often gives the same example in interviews (there are couple of them) where he compares a house sale. If for example tax of real estate is up by 10%, the seller also ups the value for +10% but buyer does not want to buy, the seller has to sell the house for the original price thus he burdens the cost of the tax because of inelasticity. I think this example is comparing apples to oranges because buyer does not share burden in this case, so he makes a trick that it is the same with tariffs, when in reality consumer is still \"robbed\" of opportunity in the first case, and not in this case.\n\nNow, the next point he makes is that inelasticity makes exporting nation pay the tariff because they don't have anywhere else to sell the product. Even after exporting company squeeze maximum margin just to stay in the market, part of the cost is still shared with the consumer, because consumer would never fully capitalize from squeezing margins even if price is now lower than it previously was.\n\nFinal thought, I think it is in the spectrum of who burdens the cost by how much.\n\nAll thoughts are welcomed, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right, want to hear what you think of this!",

Sure, if everyone decided they are unwilling to pay an extra 25% for that new grill or tv then there would be a chance that corporations would lower prices or exporters would have to eat the tariff to move their goods, but Covid proved that this is not going to happen. \n\nAmericans watched prices surge the unseen levels during the supply chain issues caused by Covid and they kept buying. Sure, overall transactions dropped for most retailers but not enough to impact revenue as the prices were high enough to offset the loss of transactions. Retailers became pros at running lower transactions, slightly lower revenue, but more profit. They decided to see how far they could squeeze the consumer and they found out that there is no end point. \n\nUntil the American consumer starts to play their role in capitalism, pricing is going to continue to surge based on any situation corporations can use to do it. It is amazing hearing people complain about how everything costs double what it did 5 years ago while filling their cart full of overpriced items they don’t need to survive. This is why the American consumer will ultimately pay the price for these tariffs, because they won’t do anything that could possibly lead to them not bearing the brunt of the increase.",

It's similar to what happened in Venezuela when the government started forcing prices to stay low, companies couldn't stay afloat, went bankrupt, and products vanished from store shelves. Honestly, his argument feels out of touch with basic economics. \n\nIs Stephen Miran a communist who believe companies do business without cost? He's either that or an idiot.",

That is worth acknowledging, but still doesn’t make the tariffs a good idea. \n\nThe notion of strengthening the US dollar is also a bit strange. The most reliable way to do that would be to increase the interest rate, which is the opposite of what the White House wants. A strong dollar would also counter the objective of making domestic manufacturing more competitive. \n\nThat’s one of problems with this administration. No one can say for sure what the objective is. Is it a negotiation tactic, is it a taxation strategy, is it about increasing domestic manufacturing? No one knows for sure because the explanation will probably change depending on how events unfold.",

He had a chance to destroy America's empire peacefully and to the benefit of American people using Miran's strategy. \n\n\nBut now the situation is different. His strategy won't be as effective, and he will have to sacrifice the currency to reduce the deficit. No empire means no money printing. The only way to pay back the debt and reindustrialize is to devalue the dollar. Similar to Turkey\n\n\nUS companies will be fine. The private sector will eventually thrive. The stock market will rebound. Well maybe not big tech because they will compete with vastly superior chinese companies, but manufacturing and domestic companies will reach new highs. On the other hand, anyone who has cash in dollars or is dependent on the state (public workers, retirees and most of the middle class who deoesn't invest) is fucked. ",

More like Opportunity of a Lifetime.**\n\nSo here’s the deal:\n**China controls 70–90% of global rare earths refining capacity**, depending on how drunk the analyst is. And guess what? Those shiny metals are in everything: EV motors, fighter jets, missile guidance systems, and maybe even your vibrating gaming chair.\n\nNow the U.S. and China are beefing harder than two boomers at a Costco gas station.\n\n\t•\t**Tariffs?** Check.\n\t•\t**Sanctions?** Check.\n\t•\t**Geopolitical tension so thick it makes your ex look emotionally available?** Check.\n\n**Enter Lynas**: The only non-China company that actually mines and processes heavy and light rare earths at scale. Australia-based, Western-aligned, not subject to sudden “Xi says no soup for you” bans.\nThis thing is **literally a national security play wrapped in a stonk**. The Pentagon already slipped them some funding because they don’t want Lockheed Martin crying when they run out of neodymium.\n\n**TL;DR** – When the U.S. says “screw China,” Lynas says “hold my Vegemite.”\n\n⸻\n\n**But What If We Hug It Out with China? Still Bullish, Bro.**\n\nLet’s pretend for a second the U.S. and China make peace, start holding hands, and do synchronized TikToks. That still doesn’t kill the Lynas bull thesis. Why?\n\nBecause:\n\t•\t**Diversification of supply chains** is now gospel in every boardroom and defense ministry. Even the most MBA-core CEOs now know putting 90% of your supply chain in one authoritarian basket is a bad move.\n\t•\tEVs are ramping like a crackhead on leg day, and each one needs rare earth magnets.\n\t•\tThe EU and Japan are also throwing cash at Lynas so they’re not dependent on Xi for the next iPhone chip.\n\nThis is **not a China hate play, this is a “don’t get rug-pulled by geopolitics” play.**\nAnd guess who benefits no matter what? That’s right: our boy LYSDY, printing metal and minting money.\n\n⸻\n\n**Why LYSDY Stands Out from the Rare Earth Clown Show**\n\nThere are two kinds of rare earth stocks:\n\t•\t**Lynas**, which actually has revenue, production, and a working business model.\n\t•\t**And everybody else**, which is basically a junior miner with a sketchy map, a dream, and an email from ChatGPT that says “Dear Investor.”\n\nWhy is Lynas daddy?\n\t•\t**They already mine AND refine** — no “we’re working on a pilot plant” BS.\n\t•\tTheir **Mount Weld mine is one of the richest deposits on Earth**.\n\t•\tThey have a **processing facility in Malaysia**, and they’re building a U.S. one with DoD money.\n\t•\t**Profitable**. Yes, in rare earths. That’s rarer than a Tinder match for a Reddit mod.\n\nYou want exposure to rare earths **without going full penny stock casino mode**? LYSDY is the one.\n\n⸻\n\n**Is It Recession Proof? Hell Yeah — Or at Least Recession Resistant**\n\nYou think a recession is gonna stop:\n\t•\tThe U.S. military from building missiles?\n\t•\tEV companies from chasing tax credits and ESG points?\n\t•\tGlobal governments from hoarding critical minerals like dragons on antidepressants?\n\nHell no.\n\nRare earths are like **semiconductors in the 1990s** — not optional. And unlike copper or oil, they’re not just cyclical industrial crap. They’re **strategic resources**.\n\n⸻\n\n**Risks & Red Flags (Because We’re Grownups… Kinda)**\n\nOkay, let’s pretend we’re responsible for a second. Here’s what could go sideways:\n\t•\t**Malaysia Facility Scrutiny**: Environmental activists and political noise in Malaysia could pressure operations or cause delays. (They’ve dealt with this before, but still a headline risk.)\n\t•\t**U.S. Facility Construction Risk**: The new Texas plant is still under development. Cost overruns or delays could spook investors.\n\t•\t**Rare Earth Prices Can Be Volatile**: If prices fall or China floods the market to flex, Lynas margins could get squeezed short-term.\n\t•\t**Not a U.S. Company**: Some institutional investors might skip this because it’s based in Australia and trades OTC in the U.S. (ticker: $LYSDY).\n\nBottom line: This is not risk-free, but **the tailwinds and government backing make it a rare earth stock with actual staying power.**\n\n**Final Degenerate Thoughts**\n\n**Lynas is the only rare earth stock that:**\n\n\t• Isn’t some pilot-project pipe dream\n\t• Isn’t Chinese\n\t• Isn’t bleeding cash like the rest of the clown car\n\nAnd in a world where the U.S. and China keep throwing haymakers, **LYSDY is the neutral corner where the referee hides with the prize money.**\n\n**Position**: Long LYSDY, short Chinese rare earth dominance, mentally short myself.\n**Price Target**: The Moon. Or like $12. Same thing.\n\n**Disclaimer**:\n\nThis is not financial advice.\nThis is just some internet raccoon digging through macroeconomic trash while trying to time commodity cycles between Trump tweets.\nDo your own research, consult a financial advisor, or just ask the next guy at Whole Foods with a Patagonia vest and a strong opinion on lithium.\n",

        "body": "# Fundamental Overview: \n\nPhilip Morris International (PM) has delivered solid financial results in recent quarters, underpinned by growth in both traditional combustibles and next-generation smoke-free products.\n\n**Recent Earnings Trend:** \n\nIn 2024, PM consistently beat expectations, with revenue and earnings on an upward trajectory. \n\nExample: \n\n1. Q4 2024 net revenues were $9.7 billion (up 7.3% YoY), and adjusted EPS rose 14% YoY to $1.55, topping forecasts. This capped a year in which organic net revenue grew high-single digits and adjusted EPS grew \\~9% (constant currency). \n2. Q3 2024 was similarly strong, with revenues of $9.9 billion (+8.4% YoY) and adjusted EPS $1.91 (+14% YoY) beating estimates. \n3. Earlier in 2024, growth was steadier: Q2 saw $9.5 B revenue (+5.6% YoY) and adjusted EPS $1.59 (flat YoY, but +10.6% ex-currency), while Q1 delivered $8.9 B revenue (+9.7%) and adjusted EPS $1.50 (+8.7%). PM has guided Q1 2025 adjusted EPS at $1.58–1.63 (vs. $1.50 in Q1 2024), on revenue of \\~$9.1 B (+3% YoY). Notably, the company raised full-year forecasts multiple times last year; it now projects 2025 adjusted EPS of $7.04–7.17, implying \\~8–10% growth.\n\n# Business Segments: \n\nPM has two focus points: traditional cigarettes and smoke-free products is central to its story. Marlboro Cigarettes still contribute significant revenue, and pricing power in this segment has driven gains – in Q4, combustible net revenue grew \\~6% organically on high single-digit price increases. \n\nNow, PMI’s future growth is clearly fueled by smoke-free products (notably the IQOS heated tobacco system and **ZYN nicotine pouches**) now comprise about 40% of total revenues and an even higher share of profit (42% of gross profit in Q4). In 2024, smoke-free net revenues grew at a double-digit pace (+9% YoY in Q4, +14% in Q3), showing people aren't retarded and care about their health. IQOS has \\~30.8 million users globally (as of mid-2024), and saw double digit volume growth in the EU and Japan, if Japanese mfs are using it, then it's some good stuff. Heated tobacco unit shipment volumes rose 13%+ in 2024. \n\nZYN nicotine pouches are the hottest fucking thing in the US \\~50% YoY in 2024. In Q4 alone, US ZYN volume jumped 42% to 165 million cans after PM got rid of supply constraints. Geographically, PM is well diversified: it has strongholds in the EU (Spain and Germany), Asia (Japan’s IQOS market share >29%). The US is now sucking up all the ZYNs (I have one in my mouth right now as I am typing this in class), and PMI has also regained US rights for IQOS as of 2024, giving me and other citizens more stuff to be addicted to. \n\n# Guidance & Outlook: \n\nPMI’s management is optimistic heading into 2025. They forecast net revenue growth of \\~6–8% and continue to see smoke-free products driving \\~10–12% HTU volume growth and an even larger +34–41% surge in ZYN volume this year. This outlook led PM to project 2025 EPS above consensus. PM are pussies and has a track record of conservative guidance and “beat-and-raise” performance, which has investors with a larger boner than after a gas station rhino pill. The company did take a one-time charge in 2024 (Canadian litigation settlement), causing a GAAP loss in Q4, but excluding bullshit like that, PM’s earnings quality is strong.\n\n# What the Wall Street Virgins are Saying:\n\nWall Street analysts has a positive outlook on PMI, albeit with a range of targets. In recent months, several analysts have hiked their price targets. \n\nFor example: \n\n1. Citi raised its target to $180 (from $163) while reiterating a Buy, citing the company’s strong growth prospects (smoke-free transformation and earnings momentum). \n2. Morgan Stanley lifted its target to $155 (Overweight) after Q4, highlighting confidence in PMI’s robust 2025 guidance​\n3. Stifel went to $160 (Buy), calling Q4 results “the kind we have become accustomed to” – i.e., consistently strong. \n4. UBS raised its target to $120 (from $105) but kept a Sell, showing caution even though PMI’s volume growth and improved currency outlook. But UBS analysts are pussies.\n\n**My positions: 10 x calls $165 strike expiring 04/25**\n\nTL:DR: ZYN good = PM good = Stock go up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llcufmt9d9we1.png?width=2115&format=png&auto=webp&s=49d82082c4ad760bd87d263f0983f7775f52915a\n\n",

Your outlook on investing thus should question, if tariffs are here to stay or not. And I simply don´t see the case for \"not\".

I had SPY 515 Puts 4/25 that I sold at a profit then rolled that into SPY 505 Puts for June 30. Bought a random Multifamily housing ETF (REZ) for Oct - bought at ask and instantly was down 50%. NVDA Put was green but held through today, sold some TLT Puts at a profit.\n\nWoke up today to a raging market, then figured to double down into more SPY 500 Puts for sept 19. Bought NEM Puts + CWEB calls just incase.\n\nPart of me wants to just close my eyes and either let this go to zero or look back in June to see if we're alright. Either way, this will be my last time messing with options (unless I do well). How fucked am I for market open?\n\nUPDATE on April 4/23:  \n sold my NEM (gold mining) Puts at a profit, sold my 580 4/30 call for a profit, sold my CWEB 42 call for a profit, and bout in at the top for another SPY 530 and sold a half hour later after it started dropping for a profit.  \nOnly have the long spy put positions, the REZ and nvda put contract still.   \nAccount is currently: $13,520 with $4,053 in cash with no weekly expiries.",

        "body": "If you remember my post from 5 months ago (and if you don’t, shame on you), I warned that Skechers was one Trump election away from a full-blown earnings aneurysm. They import 85% of their shoes from Asia. So naturally, a little thing called “tariffs” comes back on the menu, and boom,  Skechers pulled full-year 2025 guidance citing “uncertainty\" despite record Q1 revenues! They didn't even revise their guidance, they straight up refused to provide one! why? well i believe that if they did provide the real guidance, long-term bullish investors would scream like a little girl who just found out her iPad battery is at 2% and she’s on a 15-hour flight with no charger and no Wi-Fi.\n\n# Q1 Earnings Confirm Tariff Vulnerability\n\n# Executive Summary\n\nFive months after my original bearish thesis on Skechers (NYSE:SKX) at $73, the company has reported Q1 2025 earnings that provide striking validation of my core predictions. Despite posting superficially strong revenue growth of 7.1%, Skechers has withdrawn full-year guidance citing \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" – explicit confirmation of my tariff vulnerability thesis. With the stock now at $50 (a 32% decline since my initial coverage), the company's Q1 results reveal the fundamental weakness I outlined is materializing even faster than anticipated.\n\n# Q1 2025 Results: The Cracks Are Showing\n\n|Metric|Q1 2025 Result|YoY Change|Impact on Thesis|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$2.41 billion|\\+7.1%|Strong topline masks underlying issues|\n|Operating Margin|11.0%|\\-230 bps|**Significant margin compression**|\n|Operating Income|$265.1 million|\\-11.3%|**Profitability deteriorating**|\n|EPS|$1.34|\\+0.8%|Minimal growth despite revenue increase|\n|China Sales|$268.7 million|\\-15.9%|**Major weakness in key market**|\n|Guidance|Withdrawn|N/A|**Direct confirmation of tariff thesis**|\n\nWhat stands out most is the stark disconnect between revenue growth (+7.1%) and operating income decline (-11.3%), revealing the margin compression that forms the cornerstone of my bear thesis. This divergence confirms that Skechers can't maintain profitability in the face of rising costs – precisely the vulnerability that makes them uniquely exposed to tariff impacts.\n\n# Original Analysis: Bear/Base/Bull Case Revisited\n\nLet's revisit the specific assumptions from my original analysis to understand why we're seeing these developments:\n\n# Bear Case: $24.80\n\n|Metric|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Target Price|$24.80|\n|EV/EBITDA|4.8x LTM|\n|P/E Ratio|7.13x LTM|\n|Revenue Growth|Wholesale 4%, DTC 12% (normalized)|\n|COGS|63.7% of sales after 2026|\n|Tariff Impact|60% on Chinese imports (45% of production)|\n|Other Tariffs|10% blanket on rest of supply|\n|Probability|50/50 weighted assumption|\n\nWith tariffs now at 125% (vs. my modeled 60%), the margin compression will be even more severe than initially projected, suggesting the true bear case could drive the stock below my original $24.80 target.\n\n# Base Case: $55.90\n\n|Metric|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Target Price|$55.90|\n|EV/EBITDA|9.7x LTM|\n|P/E Ratio|16x LTM|\n|COGS|55% in terminal year (3% higher than 4-year avg)|\n|DIO|Decrease by 3 days from 3-year average|\n|Capex|Halved as % of revenue|\n\nImportantly, even my base case assumed some moderate cost pressure, with COGS rising to 55% (3% above the historical average), but didn't incorporate tariff impact. This explains why management could post record revenues in Q1 (reflecting the pre-tariff environment) while simultaneously withdrawing guidance (acknowledging the post-tariff reality).\n\n# Bull Case: $103.40\n\n|Metric|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Target Price|$103.40|\n|EV/EBITDA|17.3x LTM|\n|P/E Ratio|29.7x LTM|\n|Revenue Growth|Wholesale 4% terminal, DTC 20% constant|\n|COGS|Decrease to 2% of sales in terminal year|\n|SG&A|Decrease \\~1-2% of sales|\n|DSO|Improves by 5 days|\n|DIO|Improves by 5 days|\n\nThe bull case, which I assigned only a 5% probability, assumed operational improvements that now appear completely unrealistic in the current tariff environment.\n\n# Thesis Validation Point-by-Point\n\n# 1. Tariff Vulnerability Explicitly Confirmed\n\nThe single most important validation comes from management's own words. Their decision to withdraw full-year guidance specifically citing \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" is direct confirmation of my thesis that tariffs represent an existential threat to their business model. The company is acknowledging what I predicted five months ago: their heavy reliance on Asian manufacturing creates an unsustainable vulnerability to the current trade environment.\n\n# 2. China Dependency Exposed\n\nManagement's attempt to reframe APAC performance by highlighting \"when excluding China, sales increased 12%\" actually underscores their China problem. China sales plummeted 15.9% year-over-year to $268.7 million, making it their worst-performing region by far. This represents a significant deterioration in what has historically been one of their largest and most important markets.\n\nThe China narrative reveals an important context shift:\n\n* Q1 2024: China represented \\~14.2% of total sales ($319.5M)\n* Q1 2025: China now represents \\~11.1% of total sales ($268.7M)\n\nThis 3.1 percentage point decline in China's contribution to total sales confirms the market share erosion I predicted as local competition intensifies and Skechers loses its positioning in this critical market.\n\nThere’s even more downside risk here, given their exposure to **reciprocal tariffs from China**. Let’s be honest—no Chinese consumer, especially not a patriotic boomer, is going to shell out 100%+ in tariffs for a shoe that looks and feels like something they could buy off a folding table outside a metro station. And if that’s a tough sell in China, good luck convincing American shoppers to pay up either.\n\n# 3. Margin Structure Deteriorating\n\nThe margin story is particularly concerning for Skechers shareholders:\n\n* Operating margin declined 230 basis points to 11.0%\n* Gross margin declined 50 basis points to 52.0%\n* Operating expenses increased 12.1% (far outpacing revenue growth)\n\nThis margin compression is occurring even before the full impact of 125% tariffs flows through their income statement in Q2 and beyond. The company's inability to maintain margins even in a strong revenue quarter confirms my thesis that their business model lacks the pricing power to offset rising costs.\n\n# 4. Inventory Situation\n\nInventory stood at $1.77 billion, down 7.6% from December 31, 2024. While this represents some improvement, the absolute level remains historically elevated. More concerning is the potential for future inventory build as tariff-impacted costs flow through their supply chain, potentially leading to margin-eroding markdowns or further inventory growth.\n\n# Short Thesis vs. Q1 Results Comparison\n\n|Metric|Original Thesis Prediction|Q1 2025 Reality|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Guidance|Predicted withdrawal due to tariff uncertainty|Withdrawn citing \"global trade policies\" uncertainty|\n|China Performance|Predicted weakness and sales declines|Sales declined 15.9%, worst regional performer|\n|Margins|Predicted compression|Operating margin -230bps, gross margin -50bps|\n|Inventory|Predicted high DIO as risk|Down 7.6% QoQ but historically still elevated|\n|Revenue|Not primary concern; focus on margins|Strong at +7.1% but operating income -11.3%|\n|Tariff Impact|Central to bear thesis|Explicitly cited as reason for guidance withdrawal|\n\n# Implications Going Forward\n\nThe Q1 earnings reinforce my conviction in the bear case. While revenue growth was strong, the rapid deterioration in margins and profitability suggests the company is already feeling the impact of higher costs, even before the full brunt of 125% tariffs hits in Q2 and beyond.\n\nManagement's decision to withdraw guidance indicates they see significant downside risk to their financial performance, likely due to their inability to pass through tariff-related costs without hurting demand. This confirms my original thesis that Skechers lacks the brand equity and pricing power needed to navigate this environment.\n\nThe China narrative is particularly telling. By attempting to reframe APAC performance to exclude China, management is tacitly acknowledging the significant challenges they face in what was previously one of their most important growth markets. This reinforces my view that their international expansion strategy faces structural headwinds.\n\n# Conclusion and Price Target\n\nAt $50, Skechers has already declined 32% from the price 5 months ago of $73, but the Q1 results confirms significant additional downside remains. With margins compressing even before the full impact of tariffs, my original bear case target of $24.80 - $32 remains firmly in play.\n\nThe Q1 report provides compelling validation of my original thesis: Skechers faces fundamental challenges in its business model that make it uniquely vulnerable to the current tariff environment. The combination of China weakness, margin compression, and management's explicit acknowledgment of tariff risk through guidance withdrawal confirms the structural issues I identified are now materializing in their financial results.\n\n**Position:** Puts (see below)\n\n**Catalysts:** Tariff escalation + Q2 margin pressure + inventory overhang = realignment\n\n**Outlook:** This isn’t panic selling—it’s slow-motion repricing. And management just gave us the signal.\n\n*Disclaimer: This analysis is not financial advice. Investors should conduct their own due diligence before making investment decisions.*\n\n**All positions recently opened (expecting them to be up tomorrow as stock is down \\~7% pre-market)**\n\n*(latest one opened right before earnings and planning on keeping until the next catalysts (I will close these immediately if trump makes a tariff deal with all countries, especially with China. otherwise, waiting for Q2 impact to observe mitigation plan execution and the cost of such mitigation plan.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lxjmhnpc7vwe1.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=065553cb8fa770d8da14775ebc8852ed0df78cab\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ox356d855vwe1.png?width=2006&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc6db0548002655c8cfc2341948f026810a8c635\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6wpd0svavwe1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c445d882822b0a5aaf9ac33cd5de3326d22d662",

I suspect because they have low volatility and do not trade in high multiples like the tech stocks you all like. Domestic Lithium Refinery initiatives feel like they aren't being talked about enough right now. Especially with these tariffs, it seems that there will be a focus on in-house lithium sources. \n\nThere are also a couple of initiatives allowing for Domestic Lithium Refineries to be eligible for state and federal grants. One of these is the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.irs.gov/inflation-reduction-act-of-2022). With some simple research we can see small-cap companies getting over $30,000,000 in loans to start construction of their facilities.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Is this being completely overlooked? Or is there a reason that many lithium refinery stocks are trading so low currently?",

They are developing neutronelectric converters. They are atomic batteries using very low level neutron emitters, converted directly to electricity. It means batteries that don't need any charging and last for 50 years.\n\nThere is a big problem that USA State Media News is not reporting on technology developments happening in China. As of today, not a single western news outlet is reporting that China has detonated a non-radioactive hydrogen bomb. Totally thermal, lasting twice as long as TNT.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeJTbW3X8ns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeJTbW3X8ns)",

Oooooffff, thought i got them**\n\n**Can be locked now.**\n\n\n\nFor full disclosure:  \nYeah, i lost money on shorting this damn stock.\n\nBut with this in mind, i got angry at the the shitshow and am now trying to understand the story of how it is possible that Teslas capital expenditures halved within a year and i would like your help with this, since i am not firm enough in the matter to know if i'm missing something.\n\nI already asked a cousin of mine at the german 'Finanzamt', the equivalent of the IRS to give me his take on it. He has yet to answer me.\n\nI particularly need your help in understanding how american capital allowances work and how long they are stretched for different items.\n\nMaybe i'm wrong and this is a nothingburger. I dunno.\n\nSo, here is the thing:  \nI got a serious problem with the way it's supposed to be possible that, on one hand the 'Abschreibungen' (Google translates this as 'Capital Allowances' to me) of a company that in the last five to seven years has built most of it's biggest production facilities and the way these are noted in their books.\n\nAs i understand it, most of the capital allowances for the biggest items Tesla has to buy for the factories are, at least here in Germany, written off in a time span of 5 to 25 years, with the wide majority of items being written of after 7 for a lot of machinery, but expensive items like buildings often taking 20 to 25 years for the writeoff.\n\nIf i understand it correctly, these costs appear as capital expenditures in Teslas books.\n\nGiven that Tesla practically just built these factories, most of the capital expenditures should still be running.\n\nHow is it possible that these costs simply 'disappear' from one year to the next?  \nI'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and accept that i'm not qualified to make assumptions over fraud here. But i'd really like to be presented a compelling argument on this.\n\nI don't understand how this should be possible, unless Tesla sold off major parts of their facilities and other inventory and then leased it back or something.\n\nMaybe i'm just stupid. But please explain this to me.\n\nEdit: I'm not sure if i got lost in translation here, but again, Google translated the word \"Abschreibung\" to me as capital allowance.\n\nSo let me explain: If you are a business and buy certain, mostly expensive items, you can not simply write the costs for that into your books.  \nRather, you have to look up a long list of items and check the time the IRS gives you to use these until, theoretically, you have to buy a new one.\n\nThis process is called \"Abschreibung\" in German. Maybe there is another term for this in English.  \nWould be helpful if someone translates this correctly.\n\nEdit 2: So, one commenter noted that the terms used in the US are \"Depreciation, amortization and impairment\".  \nI think those are not the terms used by the IRS and accountants, but they explain why capital allowance exists.\n\nSince an item can still be sold for a certain value for a certain time after it's bought, it does not immediately constitute costs, even if already paid. Authorities instead calculate the costs of that item by a theoretical meassure in which it 'depreciates' in value when used for the production process, which is time.  \nI guess the IRS, in the same way as our \"Finanzamt\", has a long list of items, from computers, over cars, to buildings, that have a specific number of years to be cleared from the books as costs.\n\nIf a building, for example, has 25 years to be cleared, it means that, once bought, this building will show up as capital expenditure for 25 years after.\n\nSo: It takes years to clear these from Teslas books.  \nHow then can half these costs be gone within a year?\n\n**Found the mistake: The accounting rules for the IRS are different than for public financial statements of US companies. Oooooffff, thought i got them**\n\n**Can be locked now.**",

That actually seems great for BNTX as their competitor SMMT's drug didn't perform to expectations.\n\n**Highlights of BioNTech’s oncology programs to be presented at AACR 2025:**\n\n* BioNTech will present preclinical data characterizing the mode of action of **BNT327**. BNT327 is an investigational next-generation bispecific antibody combining PD-L1 checkpoint inhibition with VEGF-A neutralization. BNT327 showed a high binding affinity to PD-L1 and VEGF-A and efficient blocking of PD-1/PD-L1 and VEGF-A/VEGFR2 signaling. Anti-tumor activity superior to single PD-1/PD-L1 blockade or anti-VEGF-A treatment was observed in multiple tumor models. \n* First data for the combination of **BNT327 with various ADC candidates**, which are being jointly developed by BioNTech and Duality Biologics (Suzhou) Co. Ltd. (“DualityBio”), will be presented. The presentation will include preclinical evaluation of BNT327 plus ADCs, showing inhibition of tumor growth that is superior to each candidate alone. Further, early clinical data of the ongoing global Phase 1/2 trial ([NCT05438329](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05438329)) of BNT327 in combination with **BNT325/DB-1305**, a TROP2-targeting ADC candidate, including safety and early efficacy\n\nBNTX is presenting their results on **Sunday, Apr 27** and **Tue, Apr 29**. If the results are good as promised, the stock should shoot up 20%+\n\nTLDR; Buy short dated BNTX options",
